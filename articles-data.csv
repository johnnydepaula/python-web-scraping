The ex-minister shared...",23rd March 2024,https://punchng.com/how-fake-news-threatened-my-40-year-old-marriage-lai-mohammed/,Agency Report,"A former Minister of Information and National Orientation, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has recounted how fake news circulated on social media nearly destroyed his 40-year-old marriage.
The ex-minister shared his story during an event in Lagos commemorating Prof. Wole Soyinka’s 90th birthday, where he discussed “The Media in the Age of Disinformation.” The text of Mohammed’s presentation was made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday.
Mohammed, also serving as the Managing Partner of Bruit Costard, a lobbyist and public relations firm, reflected on one of the significant challenges he encountered during his tenure as minister: the rampant spread of fake news, misinformation, and disinformation.
Mohammed emphasized that fake news, disinformation, and misinformation nearly destroyed his marriage, highlighting their extensive consequences.  




He said, “Permit me to share publicly with you today for the first time, how social media threatened the foundation of my 40-year-old marriage.
“It was sometimes in 2018 when I came to Lagos from Abuja for an official assignment.
“As usual, I retire to bed about midnight, but about 3 am., my wife gently roused me from my slumber.
“At first, I panicked, fearing that there had been a security breach, but my wife’s mien belied that possibility, for she was calm and composed.”      
He continued: “Solemnly, my wife asked me if I was fully awake as there were some serious issues to discuss.
“I could not fathom what was that urgent or serious to warrant being woken up at this time of the night.
“My mind immediately did a kaleidoscope of my rascalities and escapades in the last few months”.
Mohammed said the accusation from his wife was “a bombshell” and was narrated to him in Yoruba language.
He presented the narration as follows:
“Daddy, death can come knocking at any moment, please let me also, as your wife, be a signatory to your overseas account in Ali Financial which contains 1.3 billion dollars.”
The ex-minister expressed disbelief that his wife fully believed the false story circulating about government officials, including himself, supposedly having large sums of money in overseas accounts during former President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration.
“I spent the next two hours or so, sweating to convince my wife that there is no iota of truth in the allegation.        
“I had to fetch a calculator and reproduce the Federal Appropriation Act for 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 in the middle of the night and explain to her why it is simply p
reposterous for me to have 1.3 billion dollars in a foreign account.
“I explained to her that there is no year my capital budget exceeded N5 billion, which then, at about N400 to a dollar, was just 12.5 million dollars.  Related News  Police vow to clamp down on persons spreading fake news  Ongoing police recruitment ss Free, PSC insists  FG budgets N138m to tackle fake news, print calendars   
“I explained that, even if I managed to divert every kobo of it to my personal account, it will take at least, 104 years to save the sum of 1.3 billion dollars being peddled that I stole,” he said.
Mohammed added: “My wife insisted that the whole world believed the story and that her friends had, as a result, besieged her with all kinds of requests.
“She said every effort on her part to deny the existence of this foreign account only succeeded in depicting her in the minds of her friends as a selfish, greedy and uncaring friend.
“Is my wife truly convinced of my innocence? The answer is in the wind!. “
Mohammed reiterated that social media remained the platforms of choice for the purveyors of fake news, anti-state groups, anarchists, secessionists, terrorists and bandits.
During his time in government, Mohammed remembered that his ministry uncovered 476 online publications solely dedicated to disseminating fake news against the previous administration of President Buhari.      
Mohammed specifically remembered the fake news claiming that the former president had passed away while undergoing treatment in a London hospital and had been replaced by a clone named “Jubril from Sudan.”
According to Mohammed, the problem of fake news persisted through the campaigns leading up to the 2023 general elections, during which President Bola Tinubu became a target. Videos and speeches attributed to him were manipulated and distorted to spread false information.
He mentioned that those spreading fake news were persistent in their attempts to undermine the commendable policies and programs of Tinubu’s administration.
Mohammed highlighted how fake news had grown drastically due to the use of Artificial Intelligence and deep learning techniques, enabling the creation of highly realistic fake or manipulated videos, audio recordings, or images.
“The consequences of disinformation and misinformation are far-reaching.
“They undermine democratic processes, sow discord within communities, and pose significant threats to public health and safety.
“Today, even the media is at risk of losing its credibility because of the proliferation of fake news on Social Media  
“Therefore, the media, as custodians of the public trust, must take decisive action to combat the scourge of disinformation and misinformation,” he said
Mohammed asserted that social media platforms and other intermediaries, accountable for amplifying disinformation and misinformation, should bear responsibility. He advocated for the implementation of robust regulatory frameworks to monitor and curb the spread of false information while preserving freedom of expression.
He urged social media platforms to prioritize the integrity of information above profit motives. Mohammed emphasized the importance of taking proactive measures to detect and remove harmful content from their platforms.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/07090653/01-moh-1-e1686125213640.jpg

Oba Akanbi who blamed the hike in the naira-dollar exchange rate on the scarcity of the foreign currency in the market, alleged that Nigerians were hoarding the dollar to create artificial scarcity.
 
The monarch, in a statement signed by his press secretary, Alli Ibraheem, obtained in Osogbo on Saturday, also disclosed that the availability of the dollar in the market would reduce the exchange rate and ultimately checkmate inflation.

This was made known in a statement by the NDLEA’s Director of Media and Advocacy, Femi Babafemi, shared on the agency’s website on Saturday.
The statement said, “The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency wishes to alert members of the public especially those who have loved ones abroad to a new scheme by scammers who impersonate NDLEA officers and call unsuspecting citizens to inform them of the arrest of their relatives at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport Ikeja Lagos or any other international airport in Nigeria with illicit drugs upon arrival in the country.
 “After throwing the family members into panic, the scammers then make a demand of millions of naira to facilitate the release of such persons from NDLEA custody. We have thwarted a number of such bids in the past when the family members called the agency’s official contacts for help or clarification.

Naira staged a comeback as the Federal Government decided to disclose the list of individuals involved in financing terrorism in the country.
Following the killing of soldiers in Okuama, Delta State, there have been debates and speculations surrounding a potential retaliatory attack.
Access Bank acquired the National Bank of Kenya, a significant development in the business sector that has been met with positive reception.  




Here are highlights from the week’s biggest news stories, from March 17 to March 23, 2024.
Naira recovers
Naira and Dollar
Naira showed resilience on Thursday, appreciating by N18 to close at 1,382/$ in the official market. This followed a significant gain at both the official and parallel markets the previous day, with the naira closing at N1,400/$ on Wednesday. The intraday high on Thursday reached N1,598/$, while the intraday low strengthened to N1,300/$. Increased dollar supply at the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Market contributed to the naira’s 1.3 percent appreciation. The Central Bank of Nigeria’s successful resolution of foreign exchange backlogs, totalling $7 billion, further boosted confidence in the FX market.      
Additionally, Nigeria’s external reserves grew to $34.37 billion as of March 12, 2024, and Diaspora remittances surged by 433 per cent to $1.3 billion in February. Speculators were urged to sell off their dollar holdings, as the naira is expected to appreciate further amidst CBN interventions and clampdowns on illegal currency activities.
Terror financiers unveiled
The Nigerian Sanctions Committee, in compliance with a directive from the Federal Government, disclosed the identities of entities on Monday, March 18, allegedly linked to terrorism financing. Among the nine individuals sanctioned, Kaduna-based publisher Tukur Mamu, accused of aiding terrorists in the Abuja-Kaduna train attack, was prominently listed.
Also identified were individuals suspected of terrorist activities such as attacks on St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State, and the Kuje Correctional Centre in Abuja. Six Bureau De Change firms, including West and East Africa General Trading Company Limited and Desert Exchange Ventures Limited, were implicated. The sanctions follow revelations from the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit, urging immediate asset freezing and reporting obligations on designated persons and entities as per the Terrorism (Prevention and Prohibition) Act, 2022.
Access Bank expands footprint
Access Bank announced its acquisition of the National Bank of Kenya Limited from the KCB Group Plc, as part of its expansion strategy into key African markets.
        
The acquisition of NBK, a well-established bank in Kenya with a substantial balance sheet, presents a significant opportunity for Access Bank to strengthen its presence in the East African market. Upon completion of the transaction, NBK will merge with Access Bank Kenya Plc, creating an enlarged franchise. This acquisition aligns with Access Bank’s broader objective of becoming a leading player in the Kenyan and East African markets.

Labour rift: Union vs. Party
The Nigerian Labour Congress and the Labour Party have been involved in a dispute that has many Nigerians questioning the reason for the union and the opposition party’s disagreement. A former President of the NLC, Ayuba Wabba, asserted that the Labour Party was established by the NLC to serve as a platform for members to advocate for their rights.
Former NLC President, Ayuba Wabba
The NLC instructed its state councils and political commissions to picket LP secretariats nationwide following a virtual meeting. The NLC also protested at the LP’s national secretariat, demanding the removal of the National Chairman, Julius Abure, and opposing the LP’s planned national convention.
Wabba clarified that the LP was formed by the NLC and accused the party of not honouring a consent agreement signed in June 2022, leading to the dispute and picketing actions by the NLC.
This is still a developing story.

This was contained in a statement issued in Port Harcourt by the NDDC Director, Corporate Affairs, Pius Ughakpoteni, on Saturday.
Incidentally, Doodei was the state Commissioner for Agriculture when the facility was built.  




Antai said: “We decided to take a look at this facility and see how best we can incorporate it into the NDDC Holistic Opportunities, Projects and Engagement, HOPE, programme, which has agriculture as its key component.
“The Project HOPE initiative seeks to engage youths of the region by creating employment opportunities for them. We have collated the data of the youth in the region and many of them are interested in agriculture.
“The NDDC is resolute in the quest to provide food security in the Niger Delta region and we need to engage the youth in agriculture to achieve this goal.”      
The NDDC Executive Director, Projects said he was impressed with the facilities at the Aquaculture Village, noting that the farm boasts of a hatchery, earth ponds, and feed mill, as well as fish processing and packaging units.  Related News   
He added, “We have discussed the possibility of bringing our youths from the nine states of the Niger Delta to train in the farm. After the training, ponds will be allocated to each of the trainees so they can put what they learnt into practice and start their business here first, before moving back to their various states.”
Antai said that the NDDC would go into a tripartite partnership with the necessary stakeholders, saying, “We will interface with the Bayelsa State Government and also discuss with the company. Then the three parties will sit down to discuss how to explore the best partnership that will favour the youths of the Niger Delta region.”
Antai recalled that the NDDC recently entered into a partnership with the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria, RIFAN, as part of its efforts to ensure food security in the Niger Delta region.

He regretted that the farm was underutilised.
He stated, “The arrangement we have with the state government, is to have a social enterprise model, where the government will bring in the beneficiaries to be trained and also support them with inputs, while we provide the requisite knowledge and expertise to ensure that the project succeeds.
“We want NDDC to collaborate with us in the area of capacity building, especially for the youths in the Niger Delta region.”

Addressing a press conference in Jalingo on Saturday, the leader of the forum, Nathaniel Saawua said, aside from those who were killed, those who sustained injuries in the attack have been left to foot their bills as no government official has either visited them in the hospital or contacted their families.
Saawua lamented the continuous silence of the government over the issue.
He said, “It is with a heavy heart that we come forward to address you today on the developments that followed the recent gruesome and barbaric murder of Rev. Abah Jacob and his wife, Marian Abah alongside several other persons by Ichen Militia on Wednesday, March 13, 2024 at Mararaba in Donga Local Government Area of Taraba State.  




“Rev. Abah Jacob, until his murder, was a pastor with The African Church, Kyado Archdeaconry, posted to The African Church Adi Parish in Bali Local Government Area of Taraba State. But since the gruesome murder, it appears to us that nobody is bothered because no one family of the victims has been contacted by the authorities and no official visitation to the families by any government official from Bali or Donga local government Councils.

“It is most pathetic to know that those who sustained injuries but divinely escaped were admitted at the General Hospital Bali. One person has so far died in the hospital, and some of them have little or nothing to foot the bills of the treatments they are receiving. This is even as some have resigned to fate as they have nothing that will sustain their stay at the hospital
“While we draw the attention of the authorities’ concern to this pathetic and unfortunate situation, we want to call on spirited individuals who are touched by this incidence to come to the aid of these victims and the bereaved by providing succour to them to alleviate some of their physical and emotional pains.”      
While commending the efforts of the police in Bali Division who assisted in the evacuation of the corpses of the victims who were ambushed and murdered between Gankwe and Mararaba in Donga Local Government for burial, the forum appealed for a full investigation into the murder of the commuters.
Efforts to get the reaction of the state Commissioner for Information and Reorientation, Zainab Jalingo, over the allegation of government neglect of the victims, failed as her line was not reachable at the time of filing this report.
The state governor, Agbu Kefas, in the wake of the attack last week through the Commissioner for Information and Reorientation, condemned the attack and ordered a full investigation into the attack.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/20104122/Agbu-Kefas.jpeg

He said the banner of wanted persons would be deployed in strategic locations.
He said, ” Indeed, to curb the freedom of action of terrorists and the perpetrators of insecurity across the country, the military has released banners of wanted terrorist and their cohorts.

This was contained in a statement signed by the Vice Chairman of NAUS in Osun State, Akinyemi Hammed, Deputy National President, Babalola Daniel and National Security Director of NAUS, Eruobami Ayobami on Saturday.
This is coming a few hours after the institution’s management refuted the report, saying it has not entered into any form of lease and agreement with illegal miners.
The student union, however, sympathised with the university community members who are being directly affected by these illegal operations.  




The statement read in part, “The safety, health, and well-being of thousands of students, faculty, and staff members are seriously threatened by the recent revelations regarding illegal mining activities near the university’s staff quarters and essential water sources.
“The sacredness of academia is violated when mining operations encroach on university property, endangering the quest for knowledge and enlightenment that academic institutions are designed to promote.”  Related News  Benue suspends mining activities  Osun police arrest three suspected cultists  JAMB, Osun CBT centre owner clash over accreditation   
NAUS called on concerned stakeholders to swiftly resolve the situation at the institution, saying Investigative measures are needed.      
“All pertinent parties must give the OAU crisis their immediate attention and take prompt action. We demand that the administration of the institution put the security and welfare of the student body first by acting quickly to put an end to these unlawful acts and hold those involved accountable.
“Furthermore, we implore the Federal Ministry of Environment, the Ministry of Solid Minerals, and other relevant organisations to initiate a thorough inquiry into the issue and guarantee that those responsible be held accountable.
“Additionally, we make a call to international organisations to provide their knowledge and assistance in resolving this urgent matter, which poses a threat not only to the neighbourhood but also to the environment and public health.
“Working together is essential to ensuring that our universities remain bulwarks of knowledge and advancement, free from the scourge of illicit mining and other harmful operations.
“NAUS is steadfast in its commitment to fighting for the welfare and rights of Nigerian students, and it will keep a careful eye on events at OAU,” the statement continued.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/12031748/OAU.jpg

Daniela had unknowingly carried the foetus since her youth, with doctors dismissing her complaints of stomach pain over the years.
As reported by NDTV, on Friday, Vera visited a local health centre on March 10, where she received treatment for a urinary tract infection. Subsequently, she was referred to another hospital where she underwent 3D scans.
The scan was conducted after she was transferred to Ponta Pora Regional Hospital in the central-western state of Mato Grosso do Sul, following a generalised infection contracted from a prior visit to a hospital closer to her home for treatment of the urinary infection.  




The scan revealed lithopedion, a condition derived from Greek words meaning ‘stone’ and ‘child,’ wherein an abdominal ectopic pregnancy becomes calcified around the foetus.
Despite having seven children, the presence of the calcified foetus went unnoticed until the scans revealed it.
Following surgery, Daniela was transferred to intensive care, where she passed away on March 15 due to complications from an infection.      
Prior to the discovery of the lithopedion, medical experts had initially suspected cancer. They have since determined that Daniela had been carrying the deceased foetus in her body since her last pregnancy over five decades ago.  Related News  First start, first goal!  Scientists disagree over ultrasound images showing male foetus masturbating in womb  Mother pregnant with brainless baby girl   
Dr Patrick Dezir, the head of the Ponta Pora Hospital health department, said: ‘When pregnancy occurs, it must be inside the uterus, but in some situations, pregnancy can occur outside.
‘That baby was not clinical, the patient did not have acute pain and did not have major bleeding and this diagnosis goes unnoticed and time will take care of that foreign body that was left inside the woman’s abdomen.’
Vera’s child, Rosely Almedia, said: ‘She was old and we are indigenous, she didn’t like going to the doctor, she was afraid of the equipment to take exams.
Vera had complained of abdominal pain since her first pregnancy when she was a teenager, her daughter said.
Rosely added: ‘She said so it looked like a baby was moving inside her belly and sometimes she felt sick, but we never suspected that it was that.
In 2013, something similar happened to an 82-year-old woman in Colombia. She had a stone baby in her belly for 40 years.        
For many years, the four-pound fetus stayed in her belly until she had surgery to take it out.
Lithopedion is very rare, happening in only 0.0054% of pregnancies.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/23115229/82684157-13218813-image-a-14_1710947044074.jpg

Sobowale also said there was the need to develop a water resources or water supply master plan for each of the 36 states of the federation with a well-defined action plan to address the challenge of access to safe drinking water.
The Chairman of NIWE disclosed this during a press briefing held at Bolude Oyebolu Engineering Centre, Abeokuta, to mark this year’s World Water Day.
World Water Day is held on March 22 of every year.  




This year’s theme is “Water For Peace”
He said 87% of the country’s population, translating to 179 million Nigerians, do not have access to safe drinking water.
Sobowale explained that the statistics highlighting the water crisis facing Nigeria were encapsulated in the 2021 Water, Sanitation, Hygiene National Outcome Routine Mapping, which covers 36 states of the federation and FCT.      
He said, “This report shows that up to 87% (179 million) of Nigerians do not have access to safely managed drinking water service.

“This report also revealed that access to basic water supply services is available to 67% of the population while 68% use drinking water supplies contaminated by thermotolerant coliform at the point of collection.”
He explained further that to address this challenge of acute access to safely managed drinking water, saying, “government should give full autonomy to the state water supply agencies across the country to attract investors to the sector. This will require adequate legislation that will remove unnecessary interference in their operations
“There is also a need to develop a water resources or water supply master plan for each of the 36 states of the federation with a well-defined Action Plan for implementation.
“It has also become imperative for the states to establish water regulatory agencies to adequately regulate the activities of the service providers in their domain for quality assurance.
He said, “The theme for this year World Water Day is very apt in the face of the numerous challenges facing the development and management of water resources all over the world which more often than not result in avoidable conflicts creating a serious social, financial and environmental imbalance that affects everyone.
“I cannot conclude this press briefing without letting us know that water has acted as impetus to create peace or spark conflicts. Many unnecessary wars have been fought over water in many parts of the world.        
“When water is scarce or polluted, or when people have unequal or no access to water, tension can rise. This is the reason why the government at all levels must be ready to explore every available opportunity, innovation, and collaboration that can continually enhance water supply and access to safely managed drinking water”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/25085022/water.jpg

Also, the bailiff succeeded in pasting the summons at the entrance of the state House of Assembly, which was cited by Saturday PUNCH on Friday.
The Federal High Court in Abuja, on Wednesday, declined to halt the impeachment proceedings activated by the Edo State House of Assembly against Shaibu.  




Justice James Omotosho declined an oral application by Shaibu’s lawyer, Prof. Olawoyin Awoyale, SAN, asking the court to order parties in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/321/2024, to maintain the status quo.
In declining the prayer, the judge noted that “The Governor of Edo State and the Edo State House of Assembly, who are the principal actors in the matter, have not been served with the originating summons of the suit as required by law.”

The colloquium themed, ‘De-marginalisation of South-East Zone and integration into national politics’, is hosted by the Senator, representing Anambra South Senatorial District, Senator Ifeanyi Ubah.
Speaking during the event, the Chairman of the APC, Ganduje, said Anambra State was not making the progress it was expected to make because it was not connected to the central government.
Ganduje said, “We are most grateful to participate in this dialogue that affects the South-East region. Ndigbo are an ingredient of national integration because they are mostly travelled across the country.  




“Anambra is a strategic state in the South-East, but it is not making the progress that a state is expected to make because it is not connected to the central government, and that is the missing link. It is not benefiting the state.
“From former governors; Peter Obi, Willie Obiano and now, Prof Chukwuma Soludo; governors are now using their connection with the central government to better their state. Why should Anambra State continue to live in isolation? What is the benefit for this? Even those who governed Anambra State quickly abandoned the party (All Progressives Grand Alliance) after governing the state. This is the height of selfishness.
“Anambra’s refusal to connect with the centre has denied the people of benefit and great infrastructure. Anambra has failed to transit and it is trapped. If you are not at the table, nobody will speak for you and that is the situation with Anambra since 1999. Anambra is the only state being ruled by the All Progressives Grand Alliance and the party has refused to grow.      
Also speaking, the Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodimma, advised the South-East region to key into the national integration of the APC.

Uzodimma explained that the colloquium was intended to stimulate the political party in the South-East and use it to better the region, adding that the time shall come when inventory would be taken.
“It is a thing of joy that the national leadership of the APC has acknowledged that the South-East is being marginalised. Having diagnosed this, the question is, who is this doctor that will prescribe the medicine to adopt? I think the national leader of the party is here to do that.
“We must identify national integration, national cohesion and national unity so that we can have a pan Nigerian project. The South-East is yearning for a united Nigeria where equity and justice is the yardstick and it means we must be in the room where decisions are taken.
“If we are committed to joining this programme and campaign for de-marginalisation, it means we must join the ruling political party. I think what we need is the process of precarious panacea to be part of the national consensus.
“Nigeria project today has no room for those who are in lamentation, it belongs to those who are pragmatic and they must adopt pragmatic approach, we must understand the political dynamism to navigate the terrain,” Uzodimma added.
When contacted for reactions on the development, Christian Aburime, the Press Secretary to Anambra State governor, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, simply said, “What do you expect him to say as Chairman of APC?”        
Also, the Deputy Publicity of APGA in Anambra, Obinna Okey, said, “He (Ganduje) is trying to market his party to Ndi Anambra. But the thing is that Ndi Anambra cannot be deceived by any political gimmicks.

He added that early life learning is included in the smart school initiative, and with that, the children will be absorbed from nursery to primary schools.
“They will be exposed to the modern learning environment and this will see a transition from chalkboard to smart boards and our pupils will no longer struggle with notebooks as they’ll be given notepads for their lesson notes,” adding that “our children are at the epicentre of our plans for the state.”
The governor also said that his administration is building 260 type II health centres across the wards, and 30 such health centres have already been awarded, and 100 will soon be awarded.
He further stated that the current maternal mortality rate in the state is “unacceptable and we’re doing everything to bring it down and to help tackle this.”        
He said his administration has increased the number of nurses admitted into state-owned institutions, and the schools of nursing are getting the needed face-lift.

Adelabu stated this during his official visit to Momas Electricity Meters Manufacturing Company Limited in the Ibafo area of Ogun State on Friday.
According to him, President Bola Tinubu’s government has decided to support local manufacturers to reduce their dependence on foreign goods.
“We will support and encourage local industries, those people that have taken the risk to put their equity and debt capital into production, we should support them. We also intend to incentivise them by allowing them to have access to cheap funds and long-time debt capital.  




“Lastly, we will patronise them. When they produce, we must buy those products. That’s what will give room for sustainability in their activities.
“In the power sector, it is our choice to have significant local content in our projects and in our contracts. In fact, we are trying to work on a bill that will legislate local content for the power sector, just like we have in the oil and gas sector. That is the only way we can sustain local producers,” he said.
Adelabu, who said the ministers in Tinubu’s cabinet are always on the field, acknowledged the fact that the country is passing through a lot of hardship as a result of rising inflation, the removal of fuel subsidy, harmonisation of the exchange rate and the consistent devaluation of the naira that has led to increasing prices of goods and services.      
“But we are not bothered. We are not depressed. We are not discouraged. You cannot have an omelette without breaking eggs; and without pain, there will be no gain,” he noted
The minister explained that 90 per cent of Nigeria’s inflation is attributable to import dependency.

“We are an import-dependent country. We hardly make what we consume in Nigeria. When naira loses value, it will be expensive to import things, and the prices will keep rising. The only way to prevent this is to become self-dependent and self-reliant,” Adelabu remarked.
He regretted that “The population that was supposed to be an advantage to us has turned out to be a liability.
“It should be an advantage because if we produce anything here, we have the market. With the population, we are supposed to create factories here and create employment opportunities. We shouldn’t be bothered about the price of the dollar to naira at all. But the way it is now, we are using that population to import from other countries that have created their own factories and employed their own people”.
He said it was one of the cardinal points of President Tinubu to start import substitution by supporting local industries to reduce the influx of foreign goods.
“Once we are able to satisfy local demands and still have excess, we will start pushing it offshore and start earning foreign exchange,” he added.        
Earlier, the Chairman of MEMMCOL, Kola Balogun, urged the Federal Government to create an enabling environment for local manufacturers to grow.
Balogun said the company, which was created about 30 years ago, has since been manufacturing prepaid metres locally, designing the products from scratch.
He charged the government to optimise the local capability “to streamline our proliferation of all kinds of things coming into the country for us to grow.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/06184551/Adebayo-Adelabu-e1709747150216.jpg

Nigeria has been grappling with armed conflicts such as terrorism, banditry, and clashes between farmers and herders, among other issues, resulting in the loss of numerous lives.
However, speaking during an event organised by FordMarx Nigeria Limited in collaboration with the Ministry of Water Resources to commemorate World Water Day in Abuja, the Head of the UNESCO office in Nigeria, Abdourahamane Diallo, said Nigeria was already facing a water crisis, adding that the ongoing conflicts in many parts of the country could compound the situation if not urgently addressed.
He said, “Conflict can exacerbate the existing water crisis in the country. The linkages between water and armed conflict are complex. Sustainable water management leads to prosperity and peace depending on the decisions taken by the government.  




“We will continue to support the Nigerian government in the sustainable water management of its water resources for peace and prosperity as well as achieving the SDG goal six.”
The Executive Director of FordMarx, Oforbuike Nnaji, also said Nigerians had no reason to be in a water crisis but for insecurity and corruption.
He noted that the activities of terrorists and other non-state actors were affecting his company’s drive to provide potable water to some rural communities.

Nnaji said, “Governments have come and gone, water projects have been established here and there, policies have been made, including ones not implemented, all aimed at tackling the challenge of availability and affordability of safe water, but regrettably these have not addressed the issues in the Water sector.
“Insecurity has also drastically affected the provision of water to citizens most especially in rural areas. I plead with the terrorists and bandits among others for a ceasefire. Their activities are making it difficult for people to adequately have access to potable water.”
Nnaji noted that he planned to create 50 million jobs through solar-powered irrigation and increase access to potable water for all Nigerians.
He said, “Subject to the requisite cooperation of the various Governments throughout Nigeria, it is our ultimate desire to create a minimum of 37 Million jobs in our industry, across the States and the FCT.
“The initiative when accomplished would increase access to good potable water, good health, and food security, through the modem solar-powered irrigation infrastructure.
“In fact, without doubt, solar-powered irrigation infrastructure alone can create more than 50 million jobs nationwide, in just one year alone!”
He further expressed willingness to partner with security agencies in their efforts to address the issue of insecurity.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/23094112/Abdourahamane-Diallo.jpg

Nwaomeh disclosed this on Friday in Enugu at the maiden edition of the CSO/Media Exchange organised by the Network of Water Rights Initiative in partnership with the Global Society for Anti-corruption, Correspondents’ Chapel of the Nigeria Union of Journalists and the Media Unit, Government House, Enugu.
The event was part of activities marking the 2024 International Water Day in Enugu with the theme: “Water for Peace”.
The governor’s media aide noted that the development made it difficult for engineers to work in those areas.  




He said, “These houses were built illegally and the governor said he cannot demolish the buildings rather than find an alternative ways of solving the water problems in the areas.
“As a result of this hindrance, the State Water Corporation does not have the capacity to do so many things that they needed to do.
“But this will not stop us from providing water to every home in the state as the governor is working day and night to ensure that water is made available.”      
Nwaomeh said that the governor promised to make water available 180 days after his inauguration as a governor, and he was able to meet the target.
According to him, work is seriously ongoing, and we are making progress in replacing rustic water pipes and valves in some parts of the state to ensure that all homes have access to portable and hygienic drinking water.
In his remarks, Mr Tony Adibe, who spoke on behalf of the Correspondent Chapel, urged residents of the state to support Gov. Peter Mbah to succeed in providing water for all in the state.

She said that it was incumbent upon water stakeholders to recognize the interconnectedness of water and peace, “for where there is access to clean water, there is a foundation for stability and cooperation.
“In countless regions, water scarcity exacerbates tensions and fuels conflicts. Today, let us commit to transforming water from a potential source of contention into a catalyst for cooperation.

Labour spoils for war with govs, insists states have money from subsidy removal

Indications have emerged that President Bola Tinubu may announce the new minimum wage on May 1 in commemoration of the International Labour Day and backdate its implementation to April.
Saturday PUNCH gathered that the National Minimum Wage Committee was working to ensure that all negotiations regarding the new rate were finalised before then with the expectation that the President would announce the new minimum wage in his Workers’ Day address.
A member of the committee, who spoke to Saturday PUNCH on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the issue, said, “By next week, the minimum wage committee will meet again. It’s a continuous meeting. That is a meeting where all the reports from the zonal public hearings will be collated and reported, and then, you know, that will also give the committee the direction to work with.
“Our target is to ensure that Mr President announces the minimum wage by the 1st of May, which is the Workers’ Day, for it to take effect from April. So, we are working to meet the timeline.”  




When reminded that the current minimum wage of N30,000 would cease to be valid on March 31, the committee member said it was unlikely that the new rate would be ready before then, adding that there was still a long way to go in arriving at an acceptable minimum wage for the country.
The source stated, “We have not got to the negotiation point yet. When you finish with the zones, it is the aggregate of what you collect from the zones that will determine the direction of the main committee. Now that we have finished with the zones, when the committee meets, it will collate all the positions of the zones and committee members.
“The positions of the NLC, TUC, NECA (the Nigeria Employers Consultative Association) and the government will be looked at. Then, we will look at the aggregate, find a percentage, and arrive at what will be agreeable.      
“We are going to make some adjustments. I am sure the committee will also have a private meeting with Mr President; they will look at the ability to pay, and then with the state governors. NECA will also be involved and we will see how we marry those angles. It is not a one-stop affair.”
When contacted, the Minister of Information and National Orientation, Idris Mohammed, did not take his calls and he had yet to respond to text and WhatsApp messages sent to his mobile line as of the time of filing this report.
The Special Adviser to the President on Information and Strategy, Bayo Onanuga, said he was not so conversant with the internal deliberations of the committee, but affirmed that talks were ongoing among the committee members who, he noted, were cognizant of the urgency of their assignment.
However, a presidential aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not the official spokesperson for the President, said Tinubu might not wait for May 1 to announce the new minimum wage if the committee was able to complete its assignment as scheduled, noting that ordinarily, the new wage should come into effect on April 1.
The aide said, “I don’t think the government will be able to wait until May 1 before announcing the minimum wage. The law says it should be concluded by early April.
“If the parties agree, why do they have to wait to make the announcement? Because they are negotiating and the law says negotiations should be completed by April.”
 Labour warns govs        
The Organised Labour has warned state governors that it will not accept anything less than full implementation whenever the new minimum wage becomes law as it is ready to go into battle with such governors.
Labour’s position is coming at a time when the governors are asking the National Minimum Wage Committee to consider each state’s peculiarities in arriving at an acceptable figure, even as the panel is compiling the reports of its public hearing in the different zones.
The two labour centres in the country – the Nigeria Labour Congress and the Trade Union Congress – are unanimous in rejecting the governors’ position, warning that it is a recipe for prolonged industrial unrest.
The Nigeria Governors’ Forum had urged the National Minimum Wage Committee to take into account the present circumstances, unique characteristics of individual states, and the effects on both the government and private sector employers’ ability to pay when determining the wage amount.
The NGF, in a communiqué issued after its virtual meeting, and signed by its Chairman and Kwara State Governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRasaq, made available to journalists on Thursday, stated, “Members reviewed the progress of the National Minimum Wage Committee and ongoing multi-stakeholder engagements towards agreeing on a fair minimum wage.
“Members urged the NMWC to consider the current realities, individual states’ peculiarities, and consequential impact on the capacity of the government as well as private sector employers to pay. Members also emphasized the need for proposals to be data-driven and evidence-based.”
Before now, the labour unions had said the existing national minimum wage of N30,000 was no longer realistic, citing the steep inflation rate of 31.7 per cent in February from 29.9 per cent reported by the National Bureau of Statistics in January.      
In January, the Federal Government inaugurated the tripartite committee responsible for deliberating on the national minimum wage.
Vice President Kashim Shettima inaugurated the 37-member panel at the Council Chamber of the State House in Abuja.
Comprising representatives of the federal and state governments, the private sector, and organised labour, the committee’s mandate is to propose a revised national minimum wage for the nation.
During zonal public hearings in Lagos, Kano, Enugu, Akwa Ibom, Adamawa, and Abuja, workers in the North-West requested N485,000; North-East, N560,000; North-Central, N709,000 (NLC) and N447,000 (TUC); South-West, N794,000; South-South, N850,000; and South-East, N540,000 by the NLC and N447,000 by the TUC.
However, the Adamawa and Bauchi state governments suggested N45,000 as the new minimum wage.
The NLC on Friday said governors who fail to implement the new minimum wage when it becomes a law would be breaking the law.
The Congress also noted that it was working towards ensuring that tougher sanctions would be meted on such governors.  
In an exclusive interview with Saturday PUNCH in Abuja, the spokesperson for the NLC, Benson Upah, noted that while the Federal Government had never defaulted in the payment of minimum wages, governors had never performed up to the task.
Upah said, “I want to tell you that any state that refuses to pay the new minimum wage will be breaking the law because it will be a national law. The present minimum wage of N30,000 was consensual, so the governors who have refused to pay are breaking the law.
“One of the things we are trying to do with the present negotiation is to ensure that enough sanctions are provided. We are going to ensure that sanctions are sufficiently tough to deter such criminally minded governors. When it comes to the minimum wage, the Federal Government has been adhering. We really can’t recall a situation of default in terms of payment of the minimum wage by the Federal Government.
“Where we had challenges in the past was about defiant governors and their number has been in the minority.”
Similarly, the TUC said it was unacceptable for the governors to undermine the payment of living wages to the workers with their divide-and-rule tactics, adding that state governments had no excuse to do whatever would be agreed on as the minimum wage since they now had more money available following the removal of fuel subsidy.

The Deputy President, TUC, Dr Tommy Etim, told one of our correspondents that the new minimum wage law being worked on would impose penalties on state governors and private sector employers who refused to pay the agreed sum.
He said, “Let me let you know that the Act will be amended to accommodate all those excesses, and then there will be those penalties. Definitely, the Act will be amended to take into cognizance the exclusion, the penalties, and the enforcement for any governor who decides to be recalcitrant; as well as employers of labour who decide to be recalcitrant in the implementation of the minimum wage.      
“The bottom line is that once the President signs the Minimum Wage Act, automatically, what is expected is the implementation. We don’t need to tell anybody to do the needful; the employer who hires you knows that he is going to pay you. Telling employers to pay is like telling a Pope how to prepare the Holy Communion.
“Yes, some governors could not pay the N30,000 old minimum wage; that was then and not now. If they couldn’t pay the N30,000 minimum wage, it therefore means that the Act was weak.”
Etim added, “The quantum of money they (governors) are getting from the removal of fuel subsidy is enough for them to pay. I don’t want anybody to say some governors may not want to pay the new minimum wage when it is unveiled. The ability to pay is there because they have more money accruing to them (governors) as a result of the removal of fuel subsidy.
“You know that in 2019, the sum of N30,000 was in vogue, and things were relatively still at the comfort of the masses, but in this case, have you taken a look at how much fuel is sold per litre now, the price of cooking gas, the price of bread, transportation?  If anyone talks about the ability of the state governors to pay, it therefore means that we are preparing them to hide under that premise.”
The TUC deputy president added that there was no more room for excuses by the governors.
He said the process of getting a new minimum wage was still ongoing and that the TUC’s position on it had been well articulated and that it was tenable in all the zones.
Etim stated, “That is also what we are going to table because we will not give different figures as far as the national minimum wage is concerned. The TUC will come up with a common figure, except as we speak, (NLC president, Joe) Ajaero decides to drop his ego, and then walk in line.        
“We are looking at many factors, including the ability to implement the minimum wage. It is not just for you to say N1m as minimum wage. You don’t make a caricature of a very serious matter. How do you arrive at N1m? You have to look at the ability to pay in line with the ILO (International Labour Organisation) minimum wage fixing conventions. You don’t have all those things on the ground and you are just announcing.
“That is why they (the NLC) couldn’t put their house in order. You find out that different zones came out with different minimum wages. It therefore means that the leadership did not show them the direction.
“When you look at TUC’s own, you will see that we have a direction and that is why our position on the minimum wage is in uniformity.
“However, as time goes on, we will get to the point of looking at our paper and then we will agree on our position.”
When asked if the NLC was in touch with the TUC to resolve their differences, Etim said, “I can tell you for free that nothing like that has happened. At my level in the TUC, a thing like that cannot take place without me being involved.
“Definitely, in the long run, we will come together. Let me also tell you that the mere fact that husbands and wives are quarreling does not prevent the children from eating.”
 State labour leaders      
The Chairman of the TUC in Ogun State, Akeem Lasisi, said workers in the state would not accept any excuse that the state government might want to put forward to delay the implementation of the new minimum wage.
Lasisi said once the Federal Government announces the new minimum wage, the workers expect the state government to waste no time in implementing it.
He said, “Labour will refuse to accept the lame argument that workers must bear the brunt of the high-handedness of the government.
“The government must set a good example by cutting the cost of governance. Well-compensated and motivated workers are essential for the development of a nation.
“The increase in minimum wage will result in increased productivity and this will eventually increase in monetary value without causing inflation.
“The Organised Labour in the country will not tolerate any excuse from the state governors because workers dictate the development of a nation and must be treated with utmost concern and honour.
“Should workers perish for a nation to develop? It does not require rocket science for the state government to pay a new minimum wage. State governments should escape out of the doom and enter a boom to make workers happy.      
“The minimum wage is backed by law; it is on the exclusive list. State governments’ failure to uphold their end of the bargain will be quite regrettable and unacceptable.”
Similarly, the Chairman of the TUC in Ekiti State, Sola Adigun, said there was no basis for the labour movement in the state to think that Governor Biodun Oyebanji would give excuses when the new minimum wage is unveiled.
Adigun said, “At every forum, we inform the governor that the implementation of the new minimum wage will not have any issue in Ekiti State; he has agreed to that, and by the grace of God, there is no going to be any issue.
“So, there will be no basis for us now to start crying or speaking about failure or non-implementation of what has not been agreed on.
“Labour in Ekiti State and the government will work out a meaningful minimum wage or living wage for Ekiti State workers. I don’t expect him (the governor) to do otherwise.”
The Osun State TUC Chairman, Abimbola Fasasi, said Governor Ademola Adeleke had been part of regional negotiations with labour on the new wage.
According to him, Adeleke’s involvement in the negotiations will make it easier for the labour movement to demand the payment of the new minimum wage in the state.      
“Fortunately for us here, our governor is involved in the negotiations. It makes it so easier for us here in Osun,” Fasasi stated.

Senator representing Bauchi Central, Abdul Ningi, had alleged that the National Assembly inflated the 2024 budget to N28.7tn.
In an interview, Ningi stated that although the National Assembly approved a budget of N25tn for the 2024 fiscal year, the Presidency was implementing one worth N28.7 trillion.

Reacting, Ojikutu, in an interview with Saturday PUNCH, said citizens should be well enlightened on budget monitoring.      
She said, “If Nigerians are enlightened enough to monitor the budget and its execution, and speak out when discrepancies are observed, the outflow of funds into private pockets will be greatly reduced.

Obasanjo spoke on Friday when he paid Otti a visit at his country home in Nvosi, Isiala Ngwa South Local Government Area.
While commending Otti for his courage in repealing the law, the former President expressed the hope that other governors would follow his footsteps.
He said, “I watched the television and I saw repealing of Abia pensions, and I asked you; what exactly is this? You said to me that the pension scheme for former governors here was too outrageous.  




“It’s like trouble because it allowed them to have a house in Abuja and elsewhere, and it allowed them to cart away with whatever they can, yet the pensions of ordinary people from 2014 are unpaid.
“What sort of leadership? You came and said there will be an end to that rascality. I congratulate you, and I say to you, I hope that your colleagues will follow your footsteps.”
Obasanjo congratulated Governor Otti for his tenacity and for weathering the storm to become the state governor and reminded him that a lot of work needed to be done.      
“This morning, I came in and I met you exercising, a sound mind and a sound body and I say to you, now I know your secret. I was glad when you said you do that every other day. It’s just like me playing squash on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. I think a leader must keep himself or herself in a healthy condition.
“Don’t be discouraged; you will be abused, you will be called names but if we have one-third of our states doing what should be done, this country will be a different country,” he added.
He urged the governor to pay attention to infrastructural development of the State, explaining that with infrastructure and good leadership the state will attain greater heights.

Obasanjo described Abia and South-East people in general as industrious and enterprising, adding that what the people of the zone required to achieve greatness was good leadership that would give them encouragement and support.
“I will urge you to pay adequate attention to infrastructure, because if you give infrastructure and you give the type of leadership you are giving, the people of the state will have nothing to worry about. On their own, they are enterprising. All they need is the leadership that will give them all the encouragement.
“I have always maintained that if there is any zone in this country that can really give what I call regional development, it’s the South East geo-political zone, because you are almost monolithic in everything,” the foremost statesman admonished.
Receiving the former President, Governor Otti assured him that his administration was focused and single-minded on infrastructural development, especially in Aba.        
“I want to also thank you for supporting our decision to repeal the pension law for former governors and former deputy governors. I had said yesterday as I signed the bill into law that I strongly believe that leadership is stewardship and if you’ve come to serve the people, you can’t at the same time be fleecing the people,” the governor declared.
Meanwhile, the Chairman of the Ondo State chapter of the Trade Union Congress, Mr Clement Fatuwase, commended Governor Otti for canceling the life pension for the past governors and deputies.
Fatuwase said, “What Otto did is good in the reality because these people are not supposed to be earning salaries after all they acquired while in office. How many years did they work that they are receiving pension while somebody works for 35 years without collecting pension as and when due.
“What the governors would get while they are going out is even enough to be their gratuity. These people who serve for eight years and collect life pension owe many workers 15, 20 years pension and gratuities.”
The TUC Chairman also called on other state governors across the federation to follow Otti’s example and stop payment of life pensions for former governors and deputies.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/19183303/Olusegun-Obasanjo.jpg

They said the major and common oral health problems are dental caries (tooth decay), especially among the younger population; periodontal disease (gum disease) which is common among the older population; maligned teeth, dental plaque, and mobile teeth.
The President of the Nigerian Dental Association, Dr Tope Adeyemi, stated this on Friday.
He said, “Oral health issues are increasing daily among people, because of unhealthy habits such as taking refined carbohydrates, alcohol, and smoking; yet people do not visit dentists at least twice a year. But then some of the reasons are economic in nature.

“People do not have money for routine visits to the dentists and this makes it difficult to bring down the number. People don’t have money to secure the services of dentists because of the economic downturn that we have.
“Currently, we have 4,500 dentists in the country, So, we have one dentist to 54,000 Nigerians and this ratio is further worsened when you go to the rural areas. Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation recommended one dentist to 5,000 patients, and the maximum should be one dentist to 7,000 patients.”
Also, a consultant Prosthodontist/Implantologist, Dr Kolawole Obagbemiro, stated, “We hope that the government will ensure that the national oral health policy will be implemented at its lowest level.

An emphatic knock-out victory against Cameroonian Francis Ngannou earlier this month appears to have set Joshua on a path to facing the winner of the Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk’s clash for the undisputed heavyweight championship.
Joshua has been on a comeback trail since losing his belts to Usyk in a pair of fights in 2021 and 2022.
Despite that setback in Joshua’s career, TalkSPORT quoted his net worth to be in the region of £150m before he took to the ring against Ngannou, a bout where he is widely reported to have earned £40m.


  






From the mega net worth, the British-Nigerian has been able to take care of his mum but he admitted to Good Morning Britain that his mum can’t watch him on a fight night.

“Sometimes she doesn’t show up, she stays behind and she prays a lot. She says she can’t really watch her son because she doesn’t enjoy it,” the 34-year-old former world champion said.
“It’s tough for her, of course, but she enjoys the fruits of her labour. I take care of my mum a lot, I love her dearly.”      
He added that he still lives with her as his work schedule would not enable him spend enough time with her if he moves out.
“I still live with my mum. I realised that when I started training – which I do away from home a lot – that if I’m away for 10 months of the year and then when I get back I’ve got to do commercial work I realise that if I was to move out I’d never actually see my mum.
“I’m away in various parts of the world for a lot of the time, but my actual base is at home with mum. So, I can still wake up and see her and spend time with her when
I can.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/24115735/WhatsApp-Image-2023-12-24-at-00.51.58_81e043bf.jpg

The reigning Serie A champions trained...",23rd March 2024,https://punchng.com/osimhen-resumes-training-fit-for-atalanta-clash/,Peter Akinbo,"Nigerian striker Victor Osimhen has resumed training with his Napoli teammates on Friday following his recovery from a muscle injury, PUNCH Sports Extra reports.
The reigning Serie A champions trained at the SSCN Konami Training Center in Naples, Italy, where Osimhen trained alongside his Napoli teammates who missed the international window including Matteo Politano who is also recovering from an injury.
Osimhen was originally on Finidi George’s 27-man list for the international friendlies against Ghana and Mali ahead of Nigeria’s 2026 World Cup qualifier games in June. However, due to a muscle injury that he received in the Champions League round of 16 tie against Barcelona, he had to withdraw from the squad.
The 24-year-old joined the morning session under Francesco Calzona and according to the report from AreaNapoli, he alongside Politano are going to be available for their match against Atalanta after the end of the international break on March 30.


  






The former Lille player, who played in the training match with his teammates, was applauded by Naples fans who came to watch the session.  Related News  Transfer: Six stars ready to ignite Premier League  Why Napoli ruled out Osimhen from Eagles friendlies  Osimhen doubtful for Inter clash   
Meanwhile, Osimhen is expected to leave Napoli this summer with a move to Premier League sides Chelsea or Arsenal rumoured to be on the cards while French giants Paris Saint-Germain are also credited with an interest in the African Player of The Year.
Partenopei president, Aurelio De Laurentiis who turned down a lucrative €130m bid from Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal for the Nigerian striker confirmed that Osimhen would leave the club in the summer.      
Osimhen has contributed 14 goals in 17 league appearances this season as Napoli bundled their title defense and are now chasing a top-four spot. The Italian side are seventh on the Serie A table and nine points behind fourth placed Bologna with nine games left to play this season.
With injury concerns, interntional competition in the AFCON and playing under three different coaches in 2023/24, Osimhen has struggled to hit last season’s impressive numbers for his club when he finished as Serie A top scorer with an impressive 26 goals in 32 appearances.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/21132227/Victor-Osimhen-22.jpeg
sports,I stopped goal keeping  for music  – Joe El,"Nigerian Afrobeats singer, songwriter and performer, Joel Amadi, popularly known as Joe El, talks about his goalkeeping talent, Super Eagles performance at the 2023 AFCON and his take on the team’s ...",23rd March 2024,https://punchng.com/i-stopped-goal-keeping-for-music-joe-el/,Ebenezer Bajela,"Nigerian Afrobeats singer, songwriter and performer, Joel Amadi, popularly known as Joe El, talks about his goalkeeping talent, Super Eagles performance at the 2023 AFCON and his take on the team’s new kits in this interview with EBENEZER BAJELA
Some celebrities are not passionate about sports, are you in that class?
Not at all. I am a sportsperson because I have always loved sports since I was a kid and my favourite sport is football. As a matter of fact, if I weren’t a musician I would have been a goalkeeper. I was a very good goalkeeper while growing up and it was something I did with passion.
So, why didn’t you build a career in football?


  






Like I said, I was good at it during my days in secondary school till I got to the university, but music has always secretly been that thing I knew I was going to do. While I was playing football as a teenager, I was also in the choir because I come from a music family. At the point I was playing football, more encouragement and light was coming from music faster than football. There was fame and sponsors came, I was getting shows while I was still young, and appreciation from music came earlier than football. That gave me the hope and the drive that people were already appreciating me as a musician and that I should just kick off with it. That was how the music industry took over from my football career.
Do you have any regrets choosing music over football?
No, I don’t have any regrets because I wouldn’t have dropped music for football; I’d rather do both because music will always come first. I know I was really good at goalkeeping but music is something that comes with ease while sleeping, bathing and even eating.      
For someone good at manning the posts, how do you feel watching poor goalkeeping cost the Super Eagles the 2021 AFCON quarter-finals spot and 2022 World Cup ticket?
I was upset and wished I was at the goalposts. Even the last game we played against Ivory Coast at the 2023 AFCON, I was not happy with the two goals we conceded, even though I was not going to blame the keeper Stanley Nwabali that much. The first one, the defender gave too much room for the Ivorian to pounce on the ball to score and the second goal, Ola Aina was tired and needed help, but we didn’t see that and the young man who played for Brighton in the Premier League (Simon Adingra) used the position very well until the goal was scored, even though William Troost-Ekong also could have done better. I told the people we watched the game together that the Ivorian coach must have said something to the guy (Adingra) in the dressing room after the first half because we all saw them using that (Aina’s) flank very well and it paid off eventually.
Heading to the AFCON, a lot of people didn’t give the Eagles any chance but they got to the final. How will you rate their performance?
To be honest, if I were to rate their overall performance at the tournament I would score them four out of 10 because if not for luck, we probably wouldn’t have gotten far. Actually, it was at this AFCON that I believed that luck truly exists. There were other countries that played better than the Eagles but didn’t get to the semi-finals or final. Take a look at Cape Verde and DR Congo for instance, they played very well. During the group stage, we got a penalty and an own goal that helped us through. It was in the quarter-finals against Cameroon that we actually played very well because even in the semis against South Africa we didn’t play well, though our defenders did very well. Overall, it was not an impressive performance from the team.  Related News  Global music business records 10.2% growth in 2023  The therapeutic power of music 2  Before Stardom With... Gnewzy   
What is your take on the new Eagles kit?
I have never worn a Super Eagles jersey before but when I saw these ones, for some reason I got attracted to them and I had to decide between the white and the green and finally I told myself that ‘I think I need to get one for myself.’ I like the jersey, aside from the ‘Naija’ inscription on it because the name of the country is Nigeria and not Naija, which is our slang.
Which football club do you support?        
This is the funniest thing because as much as I love football and I try to analyse it, I actually don’t have any club that I support. I have never had any particular club that I support and to date, it is still the same. At one point, I liked Chelsea because they had Mikel Obi and Didier Drogba. I love both players and because of them, I watched every Chelsea game. But since they left the club I have not watched Chelsea, I only watch football probably when I am in a gathering with people. At the moment, I derive joy watching Manchester City because of Erling Haaland, and whenever he is not on the pitch I don’t watch their games. I am not a supporter of the club but I can say I have a soft spot for them right now because of Haaland and the truth is whenever he is out injured and I know he won’t be playing I don’t bother watching them.
What were your standout qualities as a goalkeeper back in school?
Goalkeeping takes a lot and apart from the regular training that you get from the trainers, you also need to have some inbuilt qualities. You should be able to make quick decisions and have very good reflexes. When I was in school I was always patient for the (opposing) player to kick the ball and I moved immediately. I was always confident that my patience would drive me towards where a player was aiming the ball. Even if the player was (Lionel) Messi or (Cristiano) Ronaldo, I always had confidence in myself, these qualities are self-thought. Even though the coaches would tell you things to do, you also need these qualities in you to excel and I had these in me back then.
One of the oldest arguments in football is the question of who is a better player between Messi and Ronaldo…
(Cuts in) For me, it is Lionel Messi because he is naturally gifted and talented. He does things without stress and even though I haven’t sat with him one-on-one, I believe Messi doesn’t see this football as competition. He has it in him and it was just like when I came into the music industry, a lot of people were comparing me to Tuface but I was against it. Some were even encouraging me to do things to imitate Tuface but I said no because I am from a music background where I started as a gospel artist and I still am, music is in my system. Some think it was unfortunate that I had the same voice and looks as Tuface but for me, that is a credit. I won’t say because people believe that I look and sound like him I should start doing things like him, I had to be myself.
Did you disobey your parents to play football while growing up?
It happened with my music career and not football and the reason I knew I wouldn’t play football that far was because I was always having injuries like Neymar. I don’t like to see players score; I was always willing to do anything to prevent them from scoring and that is why I always got injured because I always put my body on the line.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/22223027/Joe-El.jpg
sports,"Southgate eyes Euros glory, suspends job offers",Gareth Southgate insists he won’t listen to job offers until after Euro 2024 as the England manager slammed speculation linking him to Manchester United as “completely disrespectful”...,22nd March 2024,https://punchng.com/southgate-eyes-euros-glory-suspends-job-offers/,Makua Ubanagu,"Gareth Southgate insists he won’t listen to job offers until after Euro 2024 as the England manager slammed speculation linking him to Manchester United as “completely disrespectful” to Erik ten Hag.
Southgate’s current England contract expires in December and he is yet to agree a new deal ahead of his fourth major tournament with the national team.
The 53-year-old is reportedly United’s top target to replace the under-fire Ten Hag if Old Trafford co-owner Jim Ratcliffe decided to sack the Dutchman.
Southgate on Friday said contract talks with the Football Association are on hold, with his full focus on leading England to their first men’s international trophy since the 1966 World Cup.


  






“I think there are two things from my point of view. One is that I’m the England manager. I’ve got one job, basically, to try and deliver a European Championship,” Southgate said ahead of Saturday’s friendly against Brazil at Wembley.
“And the second thing is Manchester United have a manager and I think it’s always completely disrespectful when there’s any speculation about a manager that’s in place.
“I’m president of the LMA (League Managers’ Association) so I don’t have any time for that sort of thing, really.”      
Southgate is said to have a good relationship with Dave Brailsford, who is part of Ratcliffe’s football operations team at United.

He is also on good terms with Newcastle sporting director Dan Ashworth — another potential candidate to move to Old Trafford according to reports.
Southgate’s stock is high after leading England to the 2018 World Cup semi-finals, the European Championship final in 2021 and the World Cup quarter-finals in Qatar a year later.
Irrespective of whether the chance to join United eventually comes up, Southgate said he will not speak to anyone until after the Euros.
“I think I’ve answered this every time I’ve sat with you,” Southgate said. “Yeah, my focus is a European Championship.
“If we did something, a contract, here before everybody would be saying, ‘why are you signing a contract before a Euros where you’ve got to prove yourself?’.
“I’m certainly not going to speak to anybody else ahead of that. I never have.        
“I’ve been eight years in the job. I wouldn’t entertain speaking to anybody else when I’m in the job.”

sports,England captain Kane to miss Brazil clash,England captain Harry Kane will miss Saturday’s friendly against Brazil and is “extremely doubtful” to face Belgium next week. Kane suffered an ankle injury playing for Bayern Munich...,22nd March 2024,https://punchng.com/england-captain-kane-to-miss-brazil-clash/,Makua Ubanagu,"England captain Harry Kane will miss Saturday’s friendly against Brazil and is “extremely doubtful” to face Belgium next week.
Kane suffered an ankle injury playing for Bayern Munich in their 5-2 win over Darmstadt last weekend and will not be risked for the meeting with Brazil at Wembley.
The former Tottenham striker also faces the possibility of missing Tuesday’s friendly against Belgium at Wembley
That will be the final match before England boss Gareth Southgate names his Euro 2024 squad, although Kane has no worries about his place on the flight to Germany in June.


  






Ajax midfielder Jordan Henderson and Chelsea forward Cole Palmer remain with the England squad, but they are also sidelined by injuries for the sold-out clash against the Selecao.
Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka withdrew from Southgate’s squad due to injury on Thursday.
“Tomorrow no Harry Kane, no Jordan Henderson, no Cole Palmer,” England boss Southgate said.      
“I would say Cole and Hendo have a better chance of Belgium than Harry. He’d be extremely doubtful for that.”
Kane’s absence is a blow but Ollie Watkins and Ivan Toney now have a chance to stake their claim for the role as Euro understudy to England’s record goal-scorer.
Watkins has scored three goals in nine internationals, while Toney’s one England appearance came off the bench against Ukraine this time last year.
The Brentford striker began an eight-month Football Association ban shortly after and was recalled at the first opportunity.
•⁠ ⁠’Big opportunity’ –
“Well, that is a decision we will have to make because clearly a nine is a specialist position,” Southgate said when asked how many strikers he would take to the Euros.

“They have different attributes and that would depend a little bit on injury status in other positions in the squad and also having perhaps players that can play more than one role.
“I think both of them are aware that the opportunity is a big one. But they’re both in good form, they’ve both had time with us.        
“Ollie’s been with us more recently, of course, and has done well in the games he’s played. He’s had a fabulous season for his club.
“Ivan since he’s come back into Brentford’s team has had the impact we expected him to, so they are two very good players.”
Despite the absentees, England are favourites to beat rebuilding Brazil in their first match under head coach Dorival Junior.
The Selecao have won 10 of their last 11 friendlies against European opposition but are looking to avoid losing four matches in a row since 2001.
“I’m reading that we’ve only beaten Brazil four times out of 26 games, something like that,” Southgate said.
“There are lots of matches against big opponents that we don’t have outstanding records against that this team have managed to beat – Italy twice being an example, Spain.
“So, it’s another opportunity for us to put a marker down, create a little bit more history for these boys.      
“But also we’re going to be tested in every aspect of our game, and that’s going to be a great challenge for us.”

Neymar Jr. and Alves were teammates at Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain and for Brazil.
The former Barcelona and Brazilian player was sentenced on February 22 after being convicted of raping a young woman at a Barcelona nightclub in December 2022.
The victim, who testified behind a screen to protect her identity, said Alves had violently forced her to have sex in a private bathroom of the nightclub despite begging him to release her, causing her “anguish and terror”, prosecutors said.


  






Afterwards, Alves was granted bail after a Barcelona Provincial Court granted him “provisional release” in exchange for the bail payment of one million euros.
He was also required to hand over his Spanish and Brazilian passports, remain in Spain, and present himself to court weekly.
The ruling came a day after his lawyer requested the 40-year-old’s release on grounds he had already served a quarter of his four-and-a-half-year sentence in pre-trial detention following his arrest in January 2023.      
In his statement on Thursday, Neymar’s father took to his Instagram page to dissociate himself and his son, saying, “There is speculation and an attempt is made to associate my name and that of my son with a matter that no longer belongs to us today.”  Related News  Anambra police vow sanction as man defiles 15-year-old schoolgirl  Four Argentine footballers under house arrest for raping journalist  Man rapes minor for three months, bags 20-year jail term   
He recalled that he had helped Alves before his conviction, which was “without any connection with any lawsuit.”
However, with the recent development, “the situation is different from the previous one,” he said.
Neymar Sr. wished Alves “finds with his own family all the answers he seeks.”
Read the full statement below:
“As everyone knows, at the beginning, I helped Dani Alves, without any connection with any lawsuit. In this second moment, in a situation different from the previous one, in which the Spanish courts have already ruled in favour of the conviction, there is speculation and an attempt is made to associate my name and that of my son with a matter that no longer belongs to us today. I hope that Daniel finds with his own family all the answers he seeks. For us, for my family, the matter is over.”
Another former Brazilian footballer, Robinho, 40, was ordered Wednesday to begin his jail time “immediately” in Brazil after he was sentenced in an Italian court for taking part in the 2013 gang rape of a woman at a Milan nightclub when he played for AC Milan.        
On Thursday, his legal team requested that the Supreme Court postpone the sentencing decision, made by Brazil’s highest appeals court, to allow time to challenge the legality of Robinho’s impending imprisonment.
However, lawyers for the former Manchester City and Real Madrid footballer said Thursday that they filed an appeal with the Supreme Court.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/22104104/alves-and-neymar.jpg
sports,Malaysia rejects 2026 Commonwealth Games hosting right,"Malaysia on Friday decided against hosting the 2026 Commonwealth Games because of the cost, the government said, in a fresh blow to an event seen as outdated by some. The decision, made at a cabinet m...",22nd March 2024,https://punchng.com/malaysia-rejects-2026-commonwealth-games-hosting-right/,Agency Report,"Malaysia on Friday decided against hosting the 2026 Commonwealth Games because of the cost, the government said, in a fresh blow to an event seen as outdated by some.
The decision, made at a cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, follows the withdrawal of the Australian state of Victoria last year.
“The Ministry of Youth and Sports today announced the government’s decision not to accept an offer from the Commonwealth Games Federation to host the 2026 Commonwealth Games,” Minister Hannah Yeoh said in a statement.
The CGF is scrambling to find a host after Victoria withdrew last July because of soaring costs.


  






The CGF offered Malaysia and other potential hosts 100 million pounds ($125 million) to step in with just over two years to go until the Games are supposed to take place.
But the Malaysian government said the offer was “not expected to be able to cover the entire cost of organising a large-scale sports event,” Yeoh said.
“The government wants to focus on the development of sports as well as the welfare and well-being of the people,” she added.      
Victoria’s sudden move, and the lack of an obvious alternative, triggered debate about the future of the Games, which take place every four years and were last held in Birmingham in 2022.
The CGF earlier this month hailed Malaysia’s “fantastic track record,” the country having staged the Games — which mostly includes former British colonies — in 1998.
But the CGF also suggested that Malaysia was not the only country it had approached to host the Games.
Singapore recently said it was “assessing the feasibility” of the CGF’s proposal.  Related News  Oshoba headlines Nov 25 title fights  Nigeria’s palm oil imports from Malaysia increased by 65.3% – Report  C’Wealth: Paralympic gold upgrade thrills Obichukwu   
The wealthy city-state also holds the Formula One night race annually and will be staging the World Aquatics Championships in 2025.
– ‘Reckless’ –
The prospect of Malaysia stepping in to host the Games had sparked fierce debate.        
Mohamad Norza Zakaria, president of the Commonwealth Games Association of Malaysia, had called it a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” that could put Malaysia back on the sporting map.
But doubts emerged last week over the idea after current and former senior officials expressed reservations.
Khairy Jamaluddin, a former youth and sports minister, rubbished the idea and called it “reckless” because the Games are coming up fast, leaving little time for planning.
Any host would need at least four years to upgrade venues, plan sponsorship and set up infrastructure, he told AFP.
“The Commonwealth Games is not a significant, marquee sporting event,” he added.
“As far as multi-sports Games are concerned, it is nowhere near the Olympics or even the Asian Games in terms of participation, exposure and returns,” Khairy said.

Congratulations on your invitation to the Super Eagles for the upcoming friendlies against Ghana and Mali. What were you doing when you got the invitation and what was your first reaction?
I was in my hotel room, camping ahead of a league game when I got the news, and I was like wow! I couldn’t contain my excitement and then congratulatory messages started popping on my phone. I was just pacing in the room with excitement as I replied to the messages. The feeling was special.
Since that day, have you been able to sleep normally and go through your daily activities without having to think too much about it?


  






That particular day I couldn’t sleep until 1am, but since then I haven’t been thinking too much about it because I have league games to attend to and things must be taken one at a time.
Just about a year ago, you were in the U-23 team as well. How was the experience?
That experience was amazing and being the first time I was called to represent Nigeria, it’s unforgettable.      
You were singled out for your brilliant performance for the U-23 team, any regrets not qualifying for the African tournament leading to the Olympics?
It’s a big regret, I must tell you. Everyone wants to play at the Olympics as it’s a lifetime opportunity, especially for footballers. If you are older than 23, you stand no chance again because the over-aged players that would be invited to join the team are usually from the senior national team. So, I wasn’t happy that we couldn’t make it.
At the U-23 camp, you displayed pictures you took with some Super Eagles players who were training in Abuja as well then. How excited are you, knowing that you will be sharing a dressing room with them soon?
Honestly, I didn’t think my invitation to the Super Eagles was going to be this soon. When I met the likes of (Victor) Osimhen, (Alex) Iwobi and others in Abuja last year, I was just wishing I would be in the national team like them one day. I didn’t imagine we would be training together this soon. It was cool being around those great guys. That feeling makes me feel more excited and at the same time it keeps me cool and  focused on my game.
Looking back at your journey, what are the situations that prepared you for breakthroughs like this in order to fulfil your dream of playing for Nigeria?
Looking back, I will say it again that it’s a dream come true for me to have come this far and it’s just the start. I’ve always wanted to become a footballer and watching the national team on TV as a child till now has always been a motivation. There is a little bit of luck in life but as an individual who is seeking opportunities, I have trained hard and tried to improve with every game when given the opportunity. Starting from the street of Ogbe in Benin City, it wasn’t easy, but all the same, hard work pays. Having good people around you also matters a lot and I thank my family for the mentoring and encouragement. Above all, I’m grateful to God for granting me this big opportunity.
In September last year, you were rumoured to have joined a fourth-tier Spanish club Lleida Esportiu. How were you linked with them in the first place?        
I was surprised when I saw the news too. I wasn’t even interested in leaving the NPFL to play in the fourth division. When the Tanzania offer came, it was well calculated and I left as I should, not like the other one that I was rumoured to have dumped Insurance, a club that made me.  Related News  JUST IN: Dessers, Lookman's goals secure friendly win over  Ghana  Adepoju to mentor students at FCV Gladiator Camp  Financial rules may force Forest to sell Awoniyi   
You recently moved from Bendel Insurance to Ihefu Sports Club in Tanzania. How do you think your time in the NPFL contributed to the dream of making it into the Super Eagles?
Playing in the NPFL is no joke as it is highly tasking and requires you to be on top of your mental game at all times. At Bendel Insurance, our first season in the NPFL after gaining promotion definitely brought a lot of attention to many of us and being consistent playing in the league opened the way. We set an unbeaten record of 21 games in the league and everyone had their eyes on us. The league is without a doubt one of the best in Africa and I thank the NPFL board and the NFF for improving the league and giving me the opportunity for the world to see what NPFL players are made of.
You have also been very key to your new club. Do you think your call up is as a result of moving abroad?
No. Six games in Tanzania aren’t enough to earn me a national team call up. The technical department must have been watching me from the NPFL and also the time I was in the U-23 — it all started from the NPFL.
There are seven other defenders in the squad for the friendlies. What are you looking forward to?
Those are seven great guys and seven experienced tanks to draw from. I’m going to learn new things about playing from these guys and also try to improve my game, then leave the rest to the coaches.      
How do you see your chances of getting some minutes in the friendlies?
They are friendly matches and the coaches know what they want to get from the matches, so, if called up for some minutes, it’s my duty to give them my best as well. And yes, I know I must put in the work in training to justify my inclusion. Beyond these matches, it is my desire to return with the squad for upcoming matches and I know that means I must be consistent in training and when I get back to my club.
When you get to camp, who is the first person you are going to video call?
Not really one person but my family then Bendel Insurance keeper Amas Obasogie, and Osarenkhoe Imade.
How was your growing up like?
My dad is from Kaduna my mum is from Jos. I was born and brought up in Benin City. As a result, I understand Hausa even if I don’t speak it fluently, and I also understand the Edo dialect.
So far so good, what are the achievements you are proud of in your career?  
Getting to where I am is a big achievement for a young player like me, bringing Bendel Insurance from relegation to surprising other big clubs in the NPFL and winning the Federation Cup after about 43 years for the club is also a big achievement. Also, playing in the CAF Confederation Cup is among them. Now, I am moving from being an U-23 player into the senior national team, and in no time, I will have more achievements to point to for Nigeria; that’s my prayer.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/22020231/Tarimu.jpg

“The fixture between DPR Korea and Japan, scheduled to be played on March 26, will not take place as scheduled due to unforeseen circumstances,” the AFC said in a statement.
It said the decision was taken after talks with the world football governing body FIFA and came a day after North Korea said it would not be able to stage the game in the capital Pyongyang.
North Korean officials did not say why.


  






The AFC said the matter would now be referred to “the relevant committees” in FIFA with further updates expected.
It did not confirm if the fixture would be played at a future time or place.
Earlier Friday, AFC general secretary Windsor John told AFP the game would proceed but at a neutral venue.      
The match in Pyongyang would have been the first game in North Korea for Japan’s men’s team since 2011 and a rare international football match in isolated North Korea.
Japan and North Korea’s women’s playoff for the Paris Olympics was switched from Pyongyang to neutral ground in Saudi Arabia last month.
Japanese news agency Kyodo reported on Thursday that North Korea didn’t want to host the match over fears of bacterial infections in Japan.
North Korean officials the same day told their Japanese counterparts that they could not play host, without saying why.
“They asked us during half-time if we can organise (it) in Japan,” Japan Football Association chief Kozo Tashima said after the teams met in a first qualifier in Tokyo, which the hosts won 1-0.

“I told them it was so sudden and that I cannot give them an immediate yes,” Japanese media quoted Tashima as saying.
“I told them it would take us at least two or three days (to answer). I told them it’s difficult,” he said.        
Earlier this week Japan’s foreign ministry warned football fans not to attempt to travel to the country for the match.
“As you know, North Korea takes a hostile view of Japan and travel is not recommended for the general public,” it said on X, formerly Twitter.
Fourteen government officials had been set to accompany the Japan team for the match and a small number of media outlets, broadcaster NHK reported.
Relations have long been dogged by issues including compensation for Japan’s brutal occupation of the Korean peninsula between 1910 and 1945 and more recently by Pyongyang’s firing of missiles over Japanese territory.
The abduction by North Korean agents of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s — forced to train spies in Japanese language and customs — has also long been a major point of contention.
Despite being isolated and poor, North Korea qualified for the 2010 World Cup.
But they were knocked out at the group stage following three defeats, including a 7-0 thumping by Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal.      
They also qualified in 1966 when they famously beat Italy 1-0 and made it to the quarter-finals.

“I can hardly imagine the Germany shirt without the three stripes,” Economy Minister Robert Habeck said in a statement sent to AFP.
“For me, Adidas and black-red-gold always belonged together,” Habeck said, describing the pairing of the company’s trademark stripe and the national flag colours as a “piece of German identity”.
With the homegrown sportswear brand and the economy both experiencing tough times, Habeck said he “would have hoped for more patriotism” from the German Football Association (DFB)”.


  






The DFB on Thursday said it would end its decades-long partnership with Adidas, selecting Nike as its new supplier from 2027.
The collaboration between Adidas and the national team goes all the way back to the 1950s and Germany’s first World Cup success in 1954.
The switch from Adidas was the “wrong decision”, Health Minister Karl Lauterbach said Thursday on X, formerly Twitter.      
The move saw “commerce destroy a tradition and a piece of home”, Lauterbach said.
The shock announcement came just a few months before Germany is set to host the men’s European football championships in June.  Related News  Germany football teams to swap Adidas for Nike kit in 2027  'No contact' with Klopp about Germany job, says DFB  50th anniversary: PUNCHERS begin training for novelty match   
“The national team plays in three stripes — that is as clear as the ball is round and the game lasts 90 minutes”, Bavarian state premier Markus Soeder said on X.
The German FA on Thursday said it understood the decision to drop Adidas was “emotional”.
“For us as an association, it is also a turning point when it is clear that a partnership marked by special moments is coming to an end after more than 70 years,” the DFB said on X.
The deal with Nike, which will run through 2034, was “by far the best financial offer” on the table, the DFB said.
According to the Handelsblatt financial daily, the contract with the US company was worth around 100 million euros ($108 million) a year — twice as much as the reported value of the Adidas deal.        
The money would enable the association to fulfill its commitment to “German football and its development”, the DFB said.
The new partnership would provide more support for the women’s game and grassroots sport, Nike Europe told AFP’s sports news subsidiary SID.

This is because the team was dropped by the Ministry of Sports Development before the Games, but the Nigeria Cricket Federation ensured their participation in the event.
Despite being the lowest-ranked team at the tournament, the Female Yellow Greens upset Namibia by a 47-run win in their second group game, before proceeding to claim the bronze medal with a three-wicket win over Uganda.
It was the first time cricket would feature at the African Games and the female team, just as their male counterparts, was ranked high enough to participate.


  






However, The PUNCH learnt that the female team was allegedly dropped a week after they began camping on the instructions of the ministry. But after adding to Nigeria’s medal haul at the Games, they don’t know if they will benefit from the financial rewards that will follow.
According to reports, gold medallists from the Games are entitled to $3,000 (N4.2m), silver $2,000 (N2.8m) and bronze, which the cricket team won, was pegged at $1,000 (N1.4m) as at Thursday’s exchange rate.
“We resumed camp under the ministry and after a week or thereabouts, we were told that the female team had been dropped from the African Games. At that point we were still playing our invitational tournament in Lagos,” an aggrieved player told The PUNCH.

After the NCF took care of the team’s travelling, accommodation and other logistics in Ghana, the players were invited, alongside other athletes in other sports, to a meeting with the Minister of Sports Development, Senator John Enoh.
 Sports minister John Enoh told The PUNCH he had “addressed” the issue during the meeting in Ghana but didn’t inform our correspondent if the female cricketers would be paid or not.
“I already addressed that in Accra, so I don’t expect that to be a problem. I met with them (athletes) in the Games Village and I addressed that (the issue).
However, one of the players told our correspondent that this was not the first time that they would be treated like this by the ministry.
“We are actually used to the ministry’s pattern. Even when you are preparing for the National Sports Festival or the National Youth Games, on the day you are supposed to travel, they will tell you one of the cricket teams will not be participating. Imagine how heartbreaking that can be for young athletes,” she added.
But NCF Public Relations Officer, Musa Ehizoje, is optimistic the sports ministry will reward the female cricketers after doing the country proud.
“The ministry has been very supportive of the NCF and our activities and has also contributed to the growth and development of the sport, so we are optimistic this can happen for our girls as well,” Ehizoje told our correspondent.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/08001245/Female-Yellow-Greens.jpg

Both nations have seen a few changes since their Africa Cup of Nations campaigns, with Jose Peseiro no longer in charge of the Super Eagles after his contract expired in February, while Otto Addo has returned to the Black Stars dugout.
The Eagles head into today’s game with a score to settle as it is their first meeting against Ghana since the Black Stars denied them a World Cup ticket in 2022.
Still reeling from the result of their last encounter at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium in Abuja, where a 1-1 draw against the arch-rivals denied them a place in Qatar; Finidi George’s men are all fired up for this encounter with the coach insisting the game was more than a friendly tie.


  






‘‘The team is prepared, they know what is at stake. The rivalry against Ghana is also an extra motivation and we just want to have a good game. Definitely, we want to win it and with the high spirit in camp, we can do it,’’ Finidi said.
‘‘In terms of tactics, we are not changing much. Just adding a few elements. We will be very tactical and see how we are going to win the ball as much as possible.’’  Related News  Awaziem eyes ‘good run’ with Finidi  Finidi talks tough ahead Black Stars friendly  Finidi in high spirits ahead first Eagles task   
Since 2022, when Peseiro took charge of the country’s national team, the Eagles have lost six out of eight friendly games, with the 3-2 win over Mozambique last October their only victory.      
Fixtures against Ghana and Mali over the international break could help to change the awful run of results, and Finidi hopes to begin the process of a turnaround with the first game against the Black Stars.
Meanwhile, Addo, who returns to the dugout after Chris Hughton’s departure following a group-stage elimination from the 2023 AFCON, where the Ghanaians failed to win a game, will hope to extend his unbeaten record as coach against Nigeria.
Having already avoided defeat in two meetings against Nigeria — a goalless encounter in Ghana and a 1-1 draw in the reverse fixture in Abuja — Addo could go three unbeaten against the Eagles today.
He, however, faces a tough task taking over a side that have only won one of their last eight games in all competitions — a 1-0 victory over Madagascar in World Cup qualifying.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/07214307/20240207_213902.jpg

The Super Eagles will take on Ghana in what will be the 60th encounter between them since 1951, and also face Mali four days later at the Grand Stade de Marrakech.
Finidi, who worked as an assistant with former coach, Jose Peseiro, has been appointed on interim basis by the Nigeria Football Federation to handle the team, and the 52-year-old is also among the candidates who have applied to replace the Portuguese.
In the build up to the friendly matches, Awaziem spoke highly of the ex-international at their training camp in Morocco.

Nigeria will once again cross paths with their West African adversaries in an exhibition game as both teams look to prepare for the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in June.
The game comes exactly two years after the Black Stars got the better of Nigeria, via away goals, to qualify for the Qatar 2022 World Cup. Revenge is, therefore, on the minds of the Super Eagles, who will have to find a way without their talismanic striker Victor Osimhen after the Napoli striker was ruled out of the game due to injury.
Speaking ahead of the high-profile international friendly, Omeruo described the fixture as a match that cannot be termed as a ‘friendly’ but they have been working hard and are ready for the clash.

According to WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman, Anthony Joshua will challenge the winner of the Oleksandr Usyk versus Tyson Fury bout.
Fury and Usyk will compete for all the belts on May 18 in Saudi Arabia and later in the year for a rematch.
While the negotiations for the fight have been ongoing, Joshua (28-3, 25KOs) has been patiently waiting for his chance. The British-Nigerian had defeated former UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou via second-round knockout and the prize for winning had been mentioned as facing one of the top two in the division.
According to Sulaiman, nothing will prevent Joshua from fighting Usyk or Fury.


  






“The WBC was presented a sanction request which was to fight for the undisputed. The WBC accepted that sanctioning and we accepted the rematch they have requested,” Sulaiman said as quoted by Sports Illustrated.
“But, if it is not anything to do with contractual or promotion, we would absolutely accept the winner to fight Joshua. The WBC has been very much attentive to this matter. So, we have completely freed the ground for the undisputed, for a rematch, and for another fight of that level.

The former unified heavyweight champion, who lost his titles to Usyk, is still working to regain them back. This was his third consecutive stoppage victory.
“It was unbelievable. He looked like a champion of the world – tremendous, powerful, precise and he made a statement. I am very proud and happy for him,” Sulaiman said.
“That is how the world is, they judge you by your last performance and now he is a power force and everybody is claiming he is the best heavyweight in the world, last year they were saying he was washed up. Now, everyone is saying Fury is all washed up but we will see on May 18,” he added.

The deal with Nike, which will run through 2034, was “by far the best financial offer” on the table, association CEO Holger Blask said in a statement.
The US group made a “clear commitment to the promotion of amateur sport, as well as the sustainable development of women’s football in Germany,” Blask said.
The announcement, just months before the Euro 2024 championships in Germany, was within the “usual” timeframe, Blask said.


  






The DFB would “do everything for joint success” with its long-time partner Adidas before the end of the year, DFB president Bernd Neuendorf added in the statement.
Germany’s footballers have hoisted a number of trophies while dressed in gear bearing Adidas’ three stripes, with the brand becoming almost synonymous with the team.

The collaboration between the team and kitmaker began in 1954 when West Germany sensationally beat Hungary to win the World Cup that year.      
Since then the German men’s team have lifted another three World Cups, while the women have two to their name.
The end of the kit deal with the German FA will be a bitter blow for Adidas, which reported its first loss in 30 years earlier this month amid a bitter break-up with artist Kanye West.
Adidas had been paying approximately 50 million euros ($54 million) a year to kit out the German national football teams, according to German daily Bild.

A judge ordered a 90-day house arrest for three of the four defendants, who all play for first-division club Velez Sarsfield. The fourth player was released on bail.
All four were also suspended from their team, which sits third in Argentina’s top league and features Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone among its former players.
The case arose after a 24-year-old sports journalist alleged she was raped after being invited by Uruguay international Sebastian Sosa to a hotel room in Tucuman, Argentina, on March 3, where she said the other three defendants were also waiting.


  






She said she felt dizzy after having a few drinks, laid down on a bed, and was raped.
Prosecutor Eugenia Posse is looking to bring rape charges against players Braian Cufre and Jose Florentin, while Abiel Osario is accused of sexual abuse. All three were held on house arrest.
Sosa, who was granted $57,000 bail and banned from leaving the country for 90 days, is being charged as a secondary participant.

The prosecution had asked for all four men to be placed in pre-trial detention to prevent interference in the investigation.
The players, who all testified in the hearing, could face prison sentences ranging from four to 20 years.
Football club Velez Sarsfield, based in Buenos Aires, said it had suspended the four players and ordered an internal investigation.
“The club reiterates its deepest concern about the reported events, which are clearly contrary to the principles and values of our institution,” it said in a statement Monday.
The hearing came in the same week that a Spanish court freed former Brazil international Dani Alves on bail of a million euros pending an appeal against his conviction for raping a woman at a Barcelona nightclub in December 2022.

Robinho, 40, was ordered Wednesday to begin his jail time “immediately” in Brazil after he was sentenced in an Italian court for taking part in the 2013 gang rape of a woman at a Milan nightclub, when he played for AC Milan.
On Thursday, his legal team requested that the Supreme Court postpone the sentencing decision, made by Brazil’s highest appeals court, to allow time to challenge the legality of Robinho’s impending imprisonment.
Robinho was first convicted of rape by an Italian court in 2017 and later lost an appeal in 2020, before again having his nine-year jail sentence upheld by Italy’s highest court in 2022.


  






Italian prosecutors issued an international arrest warrant for him but, as Brazil does not extradite its nationals, Italy instead requested he serve the sentence in his home country.
On Wednesday, judges in a Brasilia court ruled by nine votes to two in favor of Italy’s request, ordering that Robinho must begin his nine-year jail sentence “immediately.”  Related News  Rape: Robinho learns fate on nine-year sentence Wednesday  Rape sentence: Judge bars Robinho from leaving Brazil  Rape: Italy asks Robinho to serve nine-year prison sentence in Brazil    
The case signifies a dramatic fall from grace for the footballer, who has 100 caps for Brazil, scoring 28 goals.      
He played alongside stars including David Beckham and Zinedine Zidane at Real Madrid before joining Manchester City.
In 2009, he was briefly detained in England for an alleged sexual assault of a young woman, but the charges were dropped after an investigation.
He sought to return to boyhood club Santos in 2020 but the club suspended the deal after pressure from fans and sponsors due to his rape conviction.

With less than three months left, this year’s summer transfer window promises to be no different, with several exciting young stars and established performers rumoured to be on the move.
Here are six players who could light up the Premier League if they make the switch:
Victor Osimhen (Napoli)


  






Victor Osimhen (Napoli)
Premier League heavyweights Arsenal, Manchester United, and Chelsea are all interested in signing Napoli star man Victor Osimhen.
Manchester United is anticipated to submit a bid during the forthcoming summer transfer window in an attempt to acquire Nigerian attacker Victor Osimhen.
Osimhen is at the top of Chelsea’s list, and they have been eager to add a quality centre-forward to their ranks for most of the season.      
To get Osimhen to sign with Chelsea, reports claim that players like Didier Drogba and John Obi Mikel have been in constant communication with him.
Though additional information about Victor Osimhen’s release clause is still pending, reports in England claim that Arsenal has already had a meeting with the representative of the Napoli striker in an attempt to compete with Chelsea for his signature.
President Aurelio De Laurentiis acknowledged that when the Nigerian international signed a new contract with Napoli in December, he did so with full awareness that he would be leaving at the end of the current campaign.
While Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain are also being linked to him, the Premier League appears to be his most likely destination.
 
Jamal Musiala (Bayern Munich)
Jamal Musiala (Bayern Munich)
Despite being a key player in Bayern Munich’s midfield, Jamal Musiala’s future with the club is uncertain. The 21-year-old German, who developed in the youth academies of Southampton and Chelsea, initially represented England at the under-21 level before deciding to play for the country of his birth.        
Although Bayern Munich is eager to retain one of the brightest young talents in world football, recent reports suggest that they may be forced to let him go. Musiala is reportedly hesitant to sign a contract extension with the club after a disappointing season that cost the outgoing manager, Thomas Tuchel, his job.
This situation has alerted Musiala’s former club Chelsea, as well as Liverpool and Manchester City, who are interested in acquiring the talented midfielder. Bayern Munich’s inability to secure Musiala’s long-term commitment has opened the door for other top clubs to pursue him.
 
Alvaro Valles (Las Palmas)
Alvaro Valles (Las Palmas)
Top-quality goalkeepers are always in high demand, and the performances of Las Palmas goalkeeper Alvaro Valles, have not gone unnoticed.
At 26 years old, Valles was released by Real Betis as a youngster but joined the reserve team of his current club in 2018. He has gradually worked his way up through the ranks.  Related News  Osimhen resumes training, fit for Atalanta clash  Why Napoli ruled out Osimhen from Eagles friendlies  EPL: Forest fined four points for breaching financial rules   
This season, Valles has played every minute in LaLiga, conceding only 32 goals in 29 appearances—the fourth-lowest total in the league. His impressive form has caught the attention of scouts from Arsenal and Aston Villa, who have been closely monitoring the Spanish goalkeeper.      
Valles will evaluate his future options once the current campaign concludes. However, with Barcelona also expressing interest in the goalkeeper, the interested clubs must act swiftly to secure his services.
Jean-Clair Todibo (Nice)
Jean-Clair Todibo (Nice)
In France, Nice are on track to secure a continental qualification spot, largely due to having one of the best defences in Ligue 1 this season. The standout player in their formidable backline is 24-year-old Jean-Clair Todibo, who is being heavily linked with a summer transfer to Manchester United.
Todibo, a French international, joined Barcelona as a teenager but failed to make an impact in Catalonia. However, he now appears to be an elite centre-back. Manchester United’s new co-owner, Jim Ratcliffe, also holds a controlling stake in the French club, which could logically facilitate a deal.
However, recent reports suggest that senior officials at Nice will reject any inquiries for their talisman, hinting at a potential saga surrounding Todibo’s future.
Despite Manchester United’s interest and the ownership connection, Nice seem determined to keep their star defender, setting the stage for a potential transfer tussle.
Ederson (Atalanta)  
Ederson (Atalanta)
According to reports from Italy, Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United are gearing up for a transfer battle over Atalanta’s midfielder Ederson. The 24-year-old Brazilian has been one of the standout defensive midfielders in Serie A this season, ranking second for completed tackles (69) and sixth overall for interceptions (33) among central midfielders.
However, Ederson’s abilities extend beyond just tackling, as evidenced by his five league goals and impressive passing statistics.
The bidding for the Brazilian is expected to start at £30 million, and Tottenham are currently in the driving seat due to their likely qualification for European football next season.
Nevertheless, it would be unwise to count out the wealthy Newcastle United, who are planning a busy summer transfer window with multiple new arrivals at St. James’ Park.
Despite Tottenham’s advantage in terms of European qualification, Newcastle’s financial muscle could make them a formidable competitor in the pursuit of Ederson’s signature.
 
Santiago Gimenez (Feyenoord)      
Santiago Gimenez (Feyenoord)
Over the years, many players from the Dutch Eredivisie have made the move to the Premier League, with varying degrees of success. The next potential star to leap the Dutch top flight could be Santiago Gimenez, who has been in prolific form for Feyenoord this season.
With an impressive tally of 24 goals in 35 games across all competitions, it is unsurprising that the Mexican international has been linked with clubs like Arsenal, Tottenham, and West Ham United.
West Ham reportedly considered a move for Gimenez during the January transfer window, but no deal materialised. However, the Hammers are said to maintain a strong interest in the striker.
One potential deterrent for interested clubs could be Feyenoord’s hefty asking price for Gimenez, which is reported to be over £50 million.
While Gimenez’s goal-scoring exploits have garnered attention from Premier League clubs, his valuation could prove to be a significant obstacle in any potential transfer negotiations.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/21132314/Transfer-Six-stars-ready-to-ignite-Premier-League-e1711023794138.jpg

It was also the first game since revelations about a bust-up between skipper Son and Paris Saint-Germain’s Lee Kang-in at the Asian Cup, where South Korea lost 2-0 to Jordan in the last four.
Son was left with a dislocated finger in the fracas at their team hotel in Qatar on the eve of the semi-final.
Lee started on the bench on Thursday but came on soon after Thailand grabbed a shock equaliser in Seoul, with Suphanat Mueanta firing in from close range just after the hour in the World Cup qualifier.


  






Despite the stalemate, South Korea are still on course to reach the next stage of qualifying for 2026 and sit top of their group with seven points from three matches.
With under-23 coach Hwang Sun-hong taking temporary charge following the dismissal as coach of the German Klinsmann, the hosts took the lead three minutes before half-time.  Related News  N.

Spurs attacker Son inevitably scored it, turning in from close range to put South Korea on the way to a third qualifying win from as many games.      
A capacity crowd at the 66,000-seater Seoul World Cup Stadium was stunned into silence on 61 minutes when Suphanat was on hand and onside to rifle past exposed goalkeeper Jo Hyeon-woo.
South Korea had several chances to score the winner, but they failed to take them against an increasingly overworked Thailand defence.
The two sides meet again on Tuesday in Bangkok.

According to the Premier League, the City Ground landlords admitted breaching PSR by £34.5m above their permitted threshold of £61m.
The club are however are at risk of breaching financial rules again next season if they don’t sell one of their top stars in the summer and as such Awoniyi has been noted among one of the top players that the club co-owner Evangelos Marinakis could be forced to sell ahead of next season.

Despite having his two seasons blighted by injury, the Nigerian forward remains Forest top scorer since joining the club, with 16 goals across the two campaigns.      
So far this season, the 26-year-old has scored six goals, three short of Chris Wood, who is currently the club top scorer.
Premier League trio Newcastle, West Ham and Southampton have been linked with a move for the former Liverpool striker while FC Schalke 04 are also interested in the Super Eagles striker.

Recall that of the 27 pro-Wike lawmakers, 24 who were present at Friday’s emergency plenary had enacted a new law without the governor’s assent overriding Governor Siminalayi Fubara.
The action of the lawmakers followed an observation by the House Majority Leader, Major Jack, that the Rivers State House of Assembly Service Commission amendment law which was sent to the governor on February 19, 2024 had yet to be assented to by Fubara.
But the Chief of Staff, Rivers State Government House, Edison Ehie, in a statement issued in Port Harcourt on Saturday said the lawmakers lacked the powers they intend to assume. 






Ehie stated, “The Rivers State House of Assembly lacks the powers, legal or otherwise, to remove the power of appointment of the Chairman and members of the Rivers State House of Assembly Service Commission from the governor and vest that power on themselves.
“The provision in the Rivers State House of Assembly Service Commission (Amendment) Law, 2024 seeking to vest that power on the House is in clear contravention of the 1999 Constitution, and therefore, a nullity in the eyes of the law. See the case of MacFoy v UAC (1961) 3 All ER 1169 where the court held that you cannot put something on nothing and expect it to stand.”
Fubara’s aide recalled that on Thursday, February 15, 2024, during its 109th sitting, the House passed into law, the Rivers State House of Assembly Service Commission (Amendment) Bill, 2024.      
The bill, according to him, repealed the Rivers State House of Assembly Service Commission (Amendment) Law, No. 3 of 2006 and further amended the Rivers State House of Assembly Service Commission Law of 1999.
Ehie explained that the provision in the Rivers State House of Assembly Service Commission (Amendment) Law, 2024, seeking to vest that power on the House is in clear contravention of the 1999 Constitution, and therefore, a nullity in the eyes of the law.
Ehie further said the Rivers State House of Assembly Service Commission was established by the Rivers State House of Assembly Service Commission Law of 1999, saying Section 2 of the law provides that :
“The Commission shall comprise a Chairman and four other members who shall in the opinion of the Speaker be persons of unquestionable integrity.  Related News  Justice Odili bows out as 51st Body of Benchers chair  Let your name open doors with life you lead--Fubara  Wigwes’ burial: As families, friends grieve, Akpabio, Fubara banter, seek political gains   
“The Chairman and members of the Commission shall be appointed by the Rivers State House of Assembly acting on the advice and recommendation of the House Committee of Selection and shall in making the appointment be guided by the geographical spread and diversity of the people of Rivers State.”
He said that the above section was repealed by the Rivers State House of Assembly Service Commission (Amendment) Law No 3, 2006, saying that in  Sections 2 and 3, the Amendment Law provides that:
“S. 2 “Section 2 of the Principal Law is amended by repealing subsection (1) and substituting the following subsection:        
“(1) The Commission shall comprise a Chairman and four other members.
3 “Section 2(2) of the Principal Law is amended by repealing subsection (2) and substituting the following subsection:
“(2) The Chairman and members of the Commission shall be appointed by the Governor subject to the confirmation by the House of Assembly and shall in making the appointment be guided by the geographical spread and diversity of the people of Rivers State.”
Continuing, he said, “The first issue to consider is the Constitutional power of the Governor. Section 5(2) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 provides that the executive powers of the State shall be vested in the Governor of that State.” Further, Section 176(2) provides that: “The Governor of a State shall be the Chief Executive of that State.
“This follows that the governor is the Chief Executive Officer of the State Government and by the powers vested in him, is responsible for making appointments into various executive bodies, subject to the provisions of the 1999 Constitution and other statutes.
“All commissions and other parastatals are executive bodies under the control of the Governor. The House of Assembly Service Commission is an executive body and as such, the Chairman and members can only be appointed by the governor.
“The House of Assembly has no powers to make any appointment into an executive body as no statutory body is under the control of the legislature. The Rivers State House of Assembly should not mistake the presence of the building of the Service Commission in its premises as conferring powers on the House to appoint the Chairman and members of the Commission.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/31181456/Edison-Ehie.jpeg

The challenge is coming after Governor Abba Yusuf, on Friday, expressed dismay over the ongoing Ramadan feeding programme in the Kano metropolis.
The state APC chairman, Alhaji Abdullahi Abbas, threw the challenge to the governor when he flagged off the distribution of palliatives to APC leaders and supporters in the state on Saturday.
The distribution of the food items was flagged off in Dawkins Kudu local government area of Kano State. 






Abbas, who described the programme as a sham, asked the state government to show evidence that the food being provided was commensurate with what they spent on the programme.
He said, “We know the Federal Government, Dangote and BUA have provided palliatives, So, let them show evidence that they have spent the said amount on the programme.

“The grains we are distributing to our supporters were purchased through contribution from ourselves as we don’t have a government.”      
In his remark, the Chief of Staff to the APC National Chairman, Muhammad Garba, who represented his nation at the occasion, said they purchased 5, 840 50kg bags of rice, 1,600 bags of millet, 2, 000 cartons of Spaghetti to give out to their supporters and other Kano People.
Garba explained that the National Chairman of the APC, Dr. Abdullahi Ganduje coordinated the idea of the party palliative, with Deputy Senate President Barau Jibrin, and others contributed to purchasing the food items.
He said 484 wards of the state’s 44 local government areas will benefit from the gesture that will be given to all party supporters, social media influencers as well as other ordinary party staffers.
“Our National Chairman, Dr Umar Ganduje, is also planning to ensure that the palliative is sustained to cushion the effect of economic hardship, which is temporary with President Tinubu’s efforts in tackling the challenges.

The National Publicity Secretary of APGA, Ejimofor Opara, who reacted to the comment by Ganduje said Anambra, though a minority party, has remained better than most states which claim to have connected to the centre.
Ganduje, during the South-East APC colloquium held in Nnewi, Anambra State, on Friday, said Anambra is not making the expected progress because it has remained in APGA and has also refused to connect to the centre.
The APC chairman also noted that former governors who ruled Anambra State under APGA ended up leaving the APGA after ruling the state, which, according to him, further demonstrated that the party had no bearing in national importance. 






The colloquium was organised by the Senator representing Anambra South Senatorial District, Senator Ifeanyi Ubah.
But in a response on Saturday, Opara berated Ganduje, saying that his activities in Kano as governor were some of the reasons Kano chose a governor from the New Nigeria People’s Party.
Opara said, “First, I wonder the level of progress Kano State made under Ganduje’s APC that resulted in a revolutionary and historic rejection of the party by the people in 2023 as the people opted instead to vote for the NNPP and were ready to stake their lives to defend their votes.      
“Ganduje should understand that the South-East and Ndi Anambra in particular are more interested in why Kano State, after him, decided en masse to disconnect from the APC-controlled centre.

“Well, the APC is non-existent in Anambra, I am sure Ganduje himself knows this for a fact. Again, the continued existence of APGA in Anambra is performance-based.
“Anambra, and indeed the South-East is APGA land. There is no doubt about this, and even where the region decides to negotiate a handshake with the Centre, the APC has proven not to be such a viable alternative. I sincerely hope that Ganduje will seek to see that which is not hidden than opting for deliberate ignorance.”
He added, “From Peter Obi to Willie Obiano and now Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, Anambra has remained on a trajectory of progressive growth, and it is for this reason even a political neophyte would state without double checking that Ganduje was either speaking to impress his host or he is sincerely ignorant of the facts.
“Anambra under APGA has remained a state of many firsts, and in recent times the state under the Soludo government has won many awards.
“Recall that Anambra has won the award as the state with best deployed ICT, and Anambra State ICT Agency under Mr Chukwuemeka Fred Agbata won that award. Anambra has also been named as the state with the least out-of-school children record.
“If all these awards are what it takes to be disconnected from the centre, then Anambra will gladly remain disconnected.”        
Opara added that it is appalling that a political party that proposed a colloquium turned it into a political rally and ended up conducting a primary election, where the host senator, Ifeanyi Ubah was declared the candidate of the party in the next election.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/07233351/Abdullahi-Ganduje.png

 The National Working Committee of your party suspended you for six months. Do you think the suspension was justified?
Everybody knows it wasn’t justified because they only did that to cover their ills from the public because the allegations out there are clear and loud. Julius Abure should tell us that all the allegations of corruption levelled against him are false. He should just come out clearly and say that I’ve lied against him instead of trying to jump to a conclusion. But the good thing is I’ve also sued the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission so that they can investigate the account. Again, Mr Peter Obi has also come out to say that the account will be thoroughly investigated hence the reason Julius Abure has been trying to suspend him from the party.
Are you saying that Julius Abure was trying to suspend Peter Obi? 






That is the news out there because nothing is hidden. We all heard that he had been trying to do that. He has been trying to use the members of state executives. I mean the state chairmen. They’re trying to tell them that their jobs will be taken hence the reason why they all needed to come up together and stand and fight. Again, fighting for what? The allegations are clear. The allegations were too weighty to face, but he is going by the cunning way and trying to cut corners by trying to cover them. Those tracks will not be covered.
There are allegations of corruption against Abure, but the 36 state chairmen of your party dismissed the claim. Do you think the chairmen were only trying to protect him or what are your thoughts about this?
Since they know what I do not know. The matter is before the Federal High Court. When the time is right, they will be called to tell me what they know that I do not know because I see no reason. After all, they’re not in any position to clear anybody of any allegation. The allegation is based on forgery, and I am the only authority that can speak on this issue. But since they say he (Abure) did not steal and forge, that means they know what I don’t know. So, when the time is right, they will face the court to tell the court whether they know what I do not know.      
Being the national treasurer of the party, does that mean that Abure sidelined you in the process of some of the party’s financial activities?
As the national treasurer, my role is anything or everything about money. Any money that goes out and comes in must pass through me even when he (Abure) said on national television that be it cash or of transfer and everything, I’m supposed to, by the virtue of my position, receive alerts to know what is happening. Yes, he sidelined me and did not use the money for the purpose it was meant for. He has done a whole lot of harm to the image of our party. Let me set the record clear; for over seven months, I have not handled a cheque. So, if he is saying that I’ve signed a cheque with him, the public should ask him where he got the person who signed the cheque with him.
If you’ve not been handling the cheque for the last seven months, then who has been signing on behalf of the national treasurer?
That is the question we all need to ask Julius Abure.
There are several reports that the suspension was because you challenged Abure to account for some money raised from the sale of nomination forms and fundraising in the build-up to the 2023 general elections. What are your thoughts about that? 
I’m challenging him on account of everything that he has withdrawn from the party’s account. The Labour Party is an institution that has a life of its own. It is not Abure’s chambers; it is not Abure and Brothers Limited. It is an institution on its own. Every amount of money that comes in for the party should not be mismanaged. Check all the accounts. The Labour Party, as I speak, we do not have a secretariat of our own. We still pay rent where we are. Let me shock Nigerians; two months after the general election and with all the money we have got, Abure has been begging people to help us with the salaries of N1.6m monthly. That is from a party that got billions of naira.
Where on earth has it ever happened that after that huge amount made, you are still begging to pay salaries? It doesn’t make sense. I want to state also that during the off-cycle elections in Imo, Kogi, and Bayelsa States, Peter Obi appealed that if we wanted to set our records clear and stand out as a political party with a lot of integrity, we should come down on our nomination forms. We all agreed to give back their N10m to people who acquired the form, but I want to tell you that as I speak, a lot of people’s money is still hanging. Now that people have gone to court on this money issue and the money is not in their accounts, what happened to the money?        
You also claimed that Abure did not remit the donations received from Nigerians in the Diaspora during Peter Obi’s campaign tour in the United States. What evidence do you have to back up your claim?
When he was set to leave the country, he printed a banner saying he was going on a US tour to raise money for the party, I also went online, and I saw those things.
Who printed the banner? Was it Abure or Peter Obi?
I’m talking about Abure, not Peter Obi. He (Abure) printed some fliers, not banners; talking about his US tour to raise money for the party, and I also went online and saw the website where they were doing the ticketing. Some people paid $2000, $1500, $500, $550, $100, and $75 for seats. Just convert it to naira you will know how much I’m talking about. On his return, I asked him, ‘Can we know how much you raised in the name of the party?’ He has not responded to it, and I’m reliably informed from one of those in the Diaspora that they helped him with the money that has been mismanaged.
What other steps did you take after he (Abure) allegedly refused to give an account of the money he (Abure) raised during the tour when you confronted him?
We’ve been meeting on all the issues regarding finances. On several occasions, Mr Peter Obi was on the ground to meet with us and asked Abure to do the needful, to open up the book of record so that we would start from there. But because he is a respecter of nobody, he feels he is the owner of the Labour Party and that nothing can come out of it. Let Abure come out and say he has not been using a third-party account to take money from the party.  Related News  APGA knocks Ganduje over comment on Anambra state  Obi seeks review of 2024 budget  Obi’s call for LP accounts audit not ignored – Spokesman   
Does that mean that other members of the National Working Committee of the party are also aware of the situation at hand?      
Yes, they are aware of the situation at hand. Maybe it is because Abure has always told them that he is the only one who can bring them back to the NWC; so, they all keep quiet, but I ask again, ‘Of what use will their coming back to the NWC be if they cannot make use of this opportunity to speak the truth and lead by example? Why are they trying to cover the corruption that has eaten deep under them?
How will you react to the speculation raised by some of your party members that you were a mole being used by dissidents in the party?
They are always quick at disseminating false information. What do you expect of a person who Abure handpicked? Talking about Obiora Ifoh, who was brought into the party because he was Abure’s aide and not even a top member of the LP. He was handpicked to do that. How would they say that one is a mole? They always say that to misinform Nigerians whenever one is digging up the truth. The facts are there for them to handle. Many of them are just trying to shift the attention of the public, and that is why they can come out to call me a mole. How can you call someone a mole when the person has not handled the cheque for the past seven months? I was there for the past 10 years, and I wasn’t a mole but because we are trying to follow the footsteps of Mr Peter Obi, who preaches, accountability, integrity, and transparency; now, one is called a mole. No, they are the moles deceiving Nigerians.
With the six-month suspension, do you have plans to defect to another political party? 
I have no plan whatsoever to do that. As I said, the matter is before the Federal High Court. What they did was without a fair hearing, and by my right, I am supposed to be given a fair hearing. They were trying to deceive the public and cover their ills. So, that is why they did what they did. Before the Federal High Court, I’ve also sued the EFCC to let them probe Abure and all his cronies.
But a statement was issued that you did not honour the invitation given to you by the party’s NWC to resolve the conflict. How will you react to this?
They are a bunch of liars. I can even send you screenshots of the message sent; and what they sent on the general platform to which I responded. First of all, they summoned themselves to Abuja, they met and never called me. Then after a peace meeting, they summoned me to appear before the disciplinary committee, which I saw and responded to immediately, and I said to them in my response that I wasn’t in Abuja, that I left Abuja. Again, instead of appearing before them by 10am, my flight was scheduled to land in Abuja by 2:30pm of that same day, and I humbly appeal it should be moved from 10am to 4pm of that same day. But before noon of that same day, because they already had a plan to do what they did, before noon, I felt so embarrassed that the media started calling me that Abure had gone ahead to do the worse. They are just masters at disseminating wrong information. They do that a lot.  
Some people were saying that the corruption allegation against Abure might be swept under the carpet. Do you agree with such views?
I don’t want to agree to that because as it is now, the matter is before the Federal High Court, and EFCC has already been sued to do their work. I don’t want to believe that it is going to be swept under the carpet.
Recently, some members of your party in Edo State defected to the All Progressives Congress. Will you say that the present crisis in the party inspired their defection?
How can Abure who calls himself a National Chairman be making matters worse? I said Abure was planning to do a parallel primary in Edo State. He has warned that he must have his way against the people’s choice.
What did other members of the NWC do to stop him from bringing up the parallel election?
We were watching to see how it would play out, but I tell you that Abure will bring them back during the convention. That is why it appears as though some of them are keeping quiet and playing to the gallery.
Don’t you think this (the defection) will have implications on the performance of the party in the forthcoming governorship election in Edo State?      
I am not even aware that anybody defected but if there was any defection, it was on the account of Abure’s poor management. The party itself does not have any issue but the drive of the party which is Abure himself is the person that is corrupt and must be made to step aside. If we truly want to get it right in Edo State, Abure needs to step aside so that the right thing can be done. Having Abure there will amount to us not wanting to do the right thing.
Some armed policemen recently arrested Abure. What do you feel about his arrest?
When that happened, a lot of people were calling me thinking it was me. No, it wasn’t me. Abure has been in a whole lot of mess. Everybody has almost one or two issues against Abure and he has found himself in a whole lot of mess trying to spoil the name of the party.
Looking at the current economic situation of the country, what do you think the Federal Government can do to alleviate the hardship?
We are all feeling the bite, the heat of this whole thing. I use this opportunity to call on Mr President to listen to Nigerians’ cries. We are finding it very difficult. When he came up, the first thing he gave us was fuel subsidy removal and since then, we’ve not had a breath of fresh air. Even with the high pump price of fuel, there is no food anywhere. I will appeal to his conscience that a lot of people are suffering. People are dying on the streets out of hunger. He should look inward and not bring untold hardship to the Nigerian people. He should look inward to ameliorate what is happening because it is not funny anymore, and people are carrying out protests to let him understand that things are not the way they are supposed to be.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/22192729/Oluchi-Opara.jpg

President Bola Tinubu on Thursday told the leadership of the 10th Senate that the integrity of the National Assembly remains intact in the thick of allegations of budget padding over the last few weeks.
He said his administration will always encourage cooperation between the executive and judiciary for the advancement of the nation.
Tinubu said this when he hosted the leadership of the Senate to a dinner on Thursday to break the Ramadan fast at the State House, Abuja. 






Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Ajuri Ngelale, disclosed this in a statement released in the early hours of Friday titled ‘President Tinubu: We will not allow anyone to undermine our security; killers of soldiers in Delta State will face certain justice.’
Senator Abdul Ningi (Bauchi Central, PDP) had alleged that the Tinubu-led government is implementing a budget other than the one approved on January 1, 2024.
Ningi, who chaired the Northern Senators’ Forum and Senate Committee on Population, had contended in a BBC Hausa Service interview that a N25tn budget was debated and passed, not the N28.7tn that is currently being implemented.      
He maintained that N3.7tn could not be accounted for in the 2024 budget.
However, at plenary on March 12, the Senate suspended Senator Ningi for three months over this claim.
Reacting to the allegations for the first time in public, Tinubu said, “I know the arithmetic of the budget and the numbers that I brought to the National Assembly, and I know what numbers came back.
“I appreciate all of you for the expeditious handling of the budget. Thank you very much.
“Those who are talking about malicious embellishment in the budget; they did not understand the arithmetic and did not refer to the baseline of what I brought. But your integrity is intact.”  Related News  Tinubu may announce new minimum wage on Workers’ Day  Ex-deputy gov urges citizens’ enlightenment on budget monitoring  Tinubu felicitates UBA chair, Elumelu, at 61   
Tinubu thanked the lawmakers, adding that Nigerians are at the “turning corner” of the economic challenges.
“The natural challenge we are facing will be over. On the current economic difficulty, we are about turning the corner.        
“Our revenue has improved. All we have to do is to control expenditures and manage ourselves better.
“Light is at the end of the tunnel, and Nigerians will soon smile again,” the President affirmed.
Tinubu also thanked members of the National Assembly for the speedy attention given to the Student Loan Amendment Bill, urging more tolerance, forgiveness, and charity during Ramadan.
He said the perpetrators of the killing of soldiers in Delta State will face certain justice, warning that his administration will not tolerate attacks on the military and security infrastructure.
The President also affirmed that the military would continue to enjoy the support of his administration in neutralising security threats across the country.
“Our armed forces are working hard, and we will not allow attackers to undermine the integrity and value of our armed forces and its leadership.
“We will continue to encourage and fight for our sovereignty, our individual rights to exist, and we will succeed in banishing poverty from our land,’’ the President stated.      
In his remarks, the President of the Senate, Godswill Akpabio, thanked the President for hosting the lawmakers, noting that regular interactions would enhance understanding and productive governance.
“We bring you greetings from the 10th senate. We bring you assurances of continuous collaboration because we believe strongly that for us to have two brothers from the National Assembly as President and Vice-President, and even the Chief of Staff as our member, we have no option but to work with you, and to do everything possible for this administration to succeed,’’ said Akpabio.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/27171619/Tinubuu.jpg

They also recommended changes to the constitution to allow for the creation of state police.
The reports were amongst documentations received at the 140th NEC meeting presided over by Vice President Kashim Shettima at the Aso Rock Villa, Abuja on Thursday.
Special Adviser to the Vice President on Media and Communications, Stanley Nkwocha, revealed this in a statement he signed Thursday titled, ‘NEC endorses take-off of $617M i-DICE programme across states.’ 






According to the statement, NEC is still awaiting reports from 20 states. It expressed confidence that others would support.
NEC was established by the provisions of section 153(1) and Paragraphs 18 & 19 of part I of the Third Schedule of the 1999 Constitution (as amended). Its membership comprises the 36 state governors, the Governor of the Central Bank and other co-opted government officials.
Chaired by the Vice President, NEC meets monthly to execute its mandate of “advising the President concerning the economic affairs of the Federation, and in particular on measures necessary for the coordination of the economic planning efforts or economic programmes of the various Governments of the Federation.”      
Disclosing discussions at Thursday’s NEC, the Vice-President’s spokesman, Nkwocha said, the “Secretary to NEC (Mr Nebeolisa Anako) made a presentation on submissions by states on the state policing initiative. Reports have been received by 16 states on the establishment of State police. 20 states have yet to send in report. All states across the country expressed their support for the establishment of state police for the following reasons.
“States made presentations in support of the creation of state police. States recommended changes in the constitution and the current policing structure to enable the operationalisation of the initiative.”
However, no details were given about the specific states. The Vice President’s spokesperson had affirmed that the total number would be presented at the next NEC meeting even as “the compilation is still going on”.
This comes weeks after the Federal and state governments, on February 16, 2024, resolved to develop modalities to create state police to tackle the country’s security crisis.
Abduction wave
The nation has been wracked by waves of abductions, attacks by suspected bandits and other violent crimes, reviving calls for the establishment of a multi-level policing system, including state police.
Bandits have in recent times  495 persons in Kaduna, Sokoto and Borno states.        
On March 7, over 280 pupils and teachers of Government Secondary School and LEA primary School at Kuriga, Kaduna State, were kidnaped.
The terrorists reportedly invaded Kuriga in Chikun Local Government Area, Kaduna, shooting at their targets before whisking away the pupils and teachers from both schools.
A day earlier, the United Nations confirmed the abduction of at least 200 internally displaced persons from their camp in Ngala Local Government Area of Borno State.
The UN resident and humanitarian coordinator in Nigeria, Mohamed Fall, in a statement said the abductees, including women, boys and girls, were captured while fetching firewood. Fall added that the terrorists released some older women and children below 10 years.
On March 9, bandits reportedly kidnapped no fewer than 15 Tsangaya students at Gidan Bakuso area of Gada Local Government Area in Sokoto State.
On March. 14, at least 17 Nigerian soldiers were killed while on a peace-keeping mission to douse clashes between Okuoma and Okoloba communities in Ughelli South Local Government Area of Delta State.
On February 20, bandits kidnapped over 26 travellers along the Gusau-Sokoto highway. They were said to have blocked the road around Kwaren Kirya village under Maru Local Government Area of Zamfara State and abducted travellers from a Toyota 18-seater bus and a Volkswagen golf vehicle.      
At President Tinubu’s meeting with the governors last February, the Federal Government and states agreed to recruit a yet-to-be-disclosed number of forest rangers and invest in more training to “keep our forests and our borders safe,” said the Information Minister, Mohammed Idris, when he briefed State House Correspondents after a meeting between Tinubu and the 36 state governors.
“The Federal Government and the state governments are mulling the possibility of setting up state police,” said Idris, adding that “this is still going to be further discussed.”  Related News  Imo gunmen kill two policemen, bomb patrol vehicle  Three killed as police foil robbery in Rivers  Police foil kidnap attempt on Buruku-Kaduna highway   
He explained, “A lot of work must be done in that direction. But if our government and the state governments agree to the necessity of having state police, this is a significant shift.”
“Like I said, more work needs to be done in that direction. A lot of meetings will have to happen between the federal government and subnationals to see the modalities of achieving this,” Idris noted.
On February 20, 2024, a bill proposing the creation of state police successfully passed the second reading at the House of Representatives.
The legislation titled, ‘A bill for an Act to alter the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, to provide for the establishment of State Police and related matters,’ was slated for a second reading before the end of this week.
Backed by 13 House members, the bill gained the majority’s favour in the Green Chamber, with many lawmakers arguing that the security challenges take preeminence over concerns about political victimisation by state governors.  
Meanwhile, the Presidency has said although President Bola Tinubu has given his nod for the creation of state police outfits and forest guards, Governors would ultimately determine the success of both moves.
It also said it expects the re-opening of the Nigeria-Niger border to fight the illegal influx of arms roaming the Sahel from the conflict in Libya.
Speaking exclusively with our correspondent on the issue, a presidency official who did not want to be named said, “The President told the state governors to discuss it further at the state level. A committee was set up for that. We have not heard from the committee yet. Don’t also forget that simultaneously, the national assembly is considering inserting state policing in the constitution. So, there is a consensus around state policing.
“As for the forest guards, work is going on with it. There are existing forest guards in several states, but they are under the states’ ministries of agriculture. The goal now is to strengthen their capacity by arming them properly and recruiting more people.
“Still, it all falls in the hands of states to strengthen the forest guards. That is where we are now.”
Another Presidency official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the opening of the Nigeria-Niger border was part of efforts to stall the proliferation of the small arms and light weapons non-state actors use for their enterprise.
“What I know is this: some people have linked our security problems to the situation in Libya. The Libya conflict has led to the flow of arms to Nigeria. We share a long border with Niger. And many arms are flowing into the country.      
“Our borders with our Sahelian neighbours are largely ungoverned. So, there are many arms in the hands of this bandit.
“We had to make peace with Niger because of this. It was an attempt to appease Niger. We share the same border. If we are not at peace with them, they may ignore the arms flowing in. Even the food shortage we are talking about, many goods come from Niger to Nigeria. We exacerbated things when we shut the border,” the official said.
In a similar development, the Nigeria Governors’ Forum, in a communique its issued at the conclusion of its virtual meeting, and signed by its Chairman, Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRasaq, dated Wednesday and made available to the press on Thursday, emphasised the importance of incorporating State policing as a crucial amendment in the ongoing 1999 Constitutional Amendment process to address a fundamental flaw in the national security framework.
The communique read in part “The Forum commiserated with the Governor of Delta State, H.E Sheriff Oborevwori, over the communal clash between Okuama in the Ughelli South Local Government Area and Okolaba in the Bomadi Local Government Area of Delta State, and which led to the death of many including 16 military personnel. While condemning the heinous act, members observed a minute of silence for the souls of the departed.
“Members reviewed the progress of the National Minimum Wage Committee and ongoing multi- stakeholder engagements towards agreeing on a fair minimum wage.
“Members urged the NMWC to consider the current realities, individual State peculiarities and consequential impact on the capacity of the government as well as private sector employers to pay. Members also emphasized the need for proposals to be data- driven and evidence-based.
“The Forum highlighted the need for State policing as a critical amendment in the ongoing 1999 Constitutional Amendment proceedings to correct a fundamental flaw in the national security architecture.”        
The debate for creating state police in Nigeria primarily stems from the centralised nature of the Nigerian Police Force, which many security pundits perceive as inadequate for addressing the unique security challenges across the country’s diverse regions.
Proponents argue that the outfit would bring law enforcement closer to the communities they serve, enhance the effectiveness of policing, and allow for more localised control over security matters.
However, opponents fear that state police could lead to the abuse of power, particularly in states with strong political control, potentially exacerbating regional tensions and undermining national unity.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/29013144/govs.jpg

There seems to be a crack in the Rivers State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, with members’ loyalty divided between the FCT Minister and Governor Siminalayi Fubara. What is your reaction to that?
Yes, there is an obvious crack, or I will call it disagreement based on the principle in the sense that individuals are where they are based on their personal beliefs. It all started the morning of October 30, 2023, a day the people of Rivers State were greeted with the news of Impeachment moves by members of the state House of Assembly on the governor, which first came as a big and unbelievable surprise to many. But to the general public, it was a needless and avoidable crisis. Though there were rumours of a slight misunderstanding between the incumbent governor and his predecessor which we heard had been resolved, nobody imagined it would lead to a full-blown crisis.
Those loyal to the governor are those who believe that the actions of the lawmakers were hasty, selfish, and unnecessary because the governor was just three months as of then, which was not enough time for anybody to be able to access a government whether it was doing well or not. Again, the lawmakers have not been able to tell Rivers People the reasons for the impeachment move up to date. To make matters worse, they all moved to the All Progressives Congress while talks were still going on to mend fences. On the other hand, there are others loyal to the FCT Minister who believe that the governor, for not agreeing to certain things, is not loyal and therefore should be removed. 






The State APC Caretaker Committee Chairman, Chief Tony Okocha, said recently that under Governor Siminalayi Fubara, the weekly State Executive Council meeting has not been held since January 2024. Do you agree with him?
Well, the Commissioner for Information and Communications (Joe Johnson) answered this question earlier and I would like to dwell on what the commissioner said. He asked Tony Okocha if he was a member of Governor Fabara’s cabinet and if he would know when and whether an executive council meeting was held in the state or not. He argued that all state functions were going on, including the State Executive Council meeting, which had been uninterrupted despite the political impasse in the state.
He also accused the governor of withholding local government funds. How true is that?      
My problem with Tony Okocha is that he does not crosscheck his facts before going to the media. His Excellency, Governor Fubara, had directed all the 23 council chairmen to pay the statutory minimum wage. He also approved the promotion of all employees of local government areas that are due for promotion and that they should be paid their accrued benefits. While some local government council chairmen complied with this, others didn’t, hence the governor directed the Joint Allocation Committee to ensure that the exercise was carried out in all the government councils before the funds were released for uniformity. As I speak to you, all the 23 local government councils in Rivers State have paid workers’ salaries after the exercise. The local government employees are full of praise for the present administration led by His Excellency, Sir Siminalayi Fubara.
You said recently that the political crisis in the state will end soon. What moves have the party taken to quell the situation?
The party has been up and doing right from the first day of this crisis by engaging all actors, using leaders and stakeholders alike, who have shown a willingness to serve as that bridge-building machinery that will bring peace to the party and the state because the PDP has been in firm control of Rivers State since the return of democracy in 1999; and of course it has become a way of life for the people, So, what affects the PDP here affects the entire state, and that is why all hands are on deck to bring us back as a family. As a matter of fact, even the defected lawmakers are not left out, and a lot of people are beginning to see reasons they never saw yesterday to shift grounds in the interest of the state. That is why I said that peace will return soon, and it will happen.
What is the position of the PDP stakeholders and others concerning the crisis?
The stakeholders and other party faithful are all worried about the impasse because nobody likes crises, and their position is for peace to return to our party, the ruling party in the state. That is why, as I said, the stakeholders are the machinery used by the party to drive the process of reconciliation among aggrieved members in both camps.
With the present political situation in the state, do you think that the FCT Minister, Nyesom Wike, will support his godson, Governor Fubara, for a second term in office?
In politics, it is said that there is no permanent friend, no permanent enemy, but permanent interest. It will be wrong to predict 2027 in 2024 because nobody knows what the political equation in Rivers State will look like then. Remember that nobody envisaged what is going on now. Therefore, apart from the God factor, change, apart from being a constant thing in life, is a recurring decimal in politics, which is why it always seems to be the recycling of certain individuals in the political scene. Some of the politicians that are with the FCT Minister today were once his political enemies too.        
Mind you, this crisis came about because certain persons took it upon themselves to create it in their interest. I mean those who are very close and trusted allies of the FCT Minister and Governor Fubara. What I’m saying in essence is that this crisis was orchestrated by some greedy politicians, and that is why neither the minister nor Governor Fubara can lay hands on any cogent reason for the fight. As the days went on, both leaders began to realise and came to terms with each other and made genuine peace, where the love that existed among them would be ignited again. So, there is every possibility that the FCT Minister will support Governor Fubara, come 2027.

One of the agreements in the Presidential proclamation on the Rivers State political crisis which Governor Fubara signed was for him to represent the budget to the State House of Assembly. Why hasn’t he done that till now because even the APC has accused him of running the state without a budget? 
This is a constitutional matter; in as much as we, the PDP question the neutrality of the peace agreement, the governor was not given a timeframe on when to do this or that. Remember that the governor also told Rivers people that he would not do anything that would be detrimental to the state in trying to pursue peace. This means that he will not take actions that will take the state backward because he wants peace. The APC cannot claim that the governor is running the state without a budget because a court of competent jurisdiction, in a ruling, recognised Edison Ehie as the Speaker of the Rivers State House of Assembly as he then was.
He sat and declared the seats of the defected lawmakers vacant in line with section 109 (1) g of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended. That is also backed by a Supreme Court verdict. It was based on this premise that the governor approached the Rivers State House of Assembly with the 2024 Appropriation Bill which was passed into law. That judgment has not been upturned till today as I speak to you. So, if a budget can be presented twice, it is what I cannot provide answers to because I’m not a lawyer. This is why I said that it is a constitutional matter.
What is the PDP-led government in the state doing to boost food security following the high cost of goods and hunger?
Our proactive governor who had earlier visited the SONGHAI Farms in Tai Local Government Area, the Buguma Fish Farm in Asari-Toru Local Government Area, the Cassava Processing Factory in Oyigbo, Oyigbo LG, and other agriculture-related state-owned facilities for on-the-spot assessment and I can tell on good authority that apart from other policies put in place by the government to ensure that the poor and downtrodden in the state do not suffer the current hardship occasioned by the economic meltdown being experienced in the country, all those facilities are at different stages of renovation and expansion, while some will soon commence operation. They not only provide enough food, but they would no doubt employ a lot of Rivers youths and take them off the streets.
There are reports that the recent appointment of 16 new Permanent Secretaries by Governor Fubara was a way of distancing the commissioners like those in Education, Works, Finance, etc, and work with the Permanent Secretaries. What is your reaction to that?      
We know the person who specialises in spreading in the state, and there is no iota of truth in that allegation. I think some persons are trying to undermine the magnanimity of the governor because this is the first time I have seen where people resign willingly from office and are accepted back with full benefits. I can tell you that those commissioners have nothing to complain about else they would have resigned again.
With the goings-on in the state politically, do you think the PDP can withstand the APC in the coming local government election in June/July?
The truth of the matter is that right from time, the PDP has won back-to-back both general and local government elections in Rivers State. The APC is not a threat to us in any way. So, we will win the local government election any time it will be held.
The Senate President, Godswill Akpabio, took a swipe at Governor Fubara during the funeral of the late former Chief Executive Officer of Access Holdings, Dr Herbert Wigwe, his wife (Chizoba), and his first son (Chizzy), when the governor asked why politicians were fighting over power and wanting to kill. How did the PDP in the state take that?
We condemn the attack on Governor Fubara by the Senate President because his reaction was not necessary. His actions against Rivers people have never been pleasant but embarrassing, as he seems to have taken advantage of the political impasse in the state to perfect his enterprise of igniting more crises to the detriment of the state.
An instance of display of obvious hatred for Rivers people by Senator Akpabio was the harassment and an attempt to take an illustrious daughter of the state, Gbene Joi Nunieh, away from her house here in Port Harcourt, during her tenure as NDDC acting Managing Director, just to make sure that she was removed. Recently, at a church service in Tai Local Government Area, the same Akpabio had made a ridiculous remark regarding the 2027 governorship election in Rivers State.
At the service, Akpabio had called on the FCT Minister, Nyesom Wike to look for somebody from the Ogoni extraction who will succeed Governor Siminalayi Fubara in 2027. Such a statement is a huge embarrassment that could provoke a crisis as the governor has not told anyone that he would not seek re-election in 2027. All these have exposed Senator Godswill Akpabio’s desire to stir up sentiments and aggravate the political crisis already confronting the state.  
It is indeed sad that rather than Senator Akpabio who is a statesman in his position as Senate President to play the role of a mediator in resolving the crises, as a South-South son, he is joining forces with the enemies of the state in fanning the embers of war, disunity, and destabilisation, through incisive and provocative comments each time he visits Rivers State, something he does not do in his home state of Akwa Ibom, also controlled by the PDP.
We however appeal to the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Senator Ahmed Bola Tinubu to caution Godswill Akpabio as his consistent throwing of tantrums at the state governor and the people is capable of provoking crisis in the state, which is against the tenets of the peace proclamation that Mr President brokered. We also advise him to concentrate more on his job as the Senate President and avoid delving into petty issues in Rivers State.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/16205945/SYDNEY-GBARA.jpg

Nigerians have continued to wonder why the economic troubles in the country have been persistent despite different measures being put in place to tackle the current economic challenges. Some have also insisted that the country’s economy has been stagnated by the continuous selection of mediocre persons who were said to be incapable of helping to resuscitate Nigeria’s current economic woes. It is a fact that a country’s economy is the oxygen which it breathes.
This can be corroborated by the words of a British politician, David Cameron, who puts it this way: “An economy is the start and end of everything. You cannot have successful education reform or any other reform if you do not have a strong economy.” This translates to how essential a nation’s economy is and how it holistically affects the country’s growth.
Since the emergence of President Bola Tinubu on May 29, which followed an immediate and unexpected removal of fuel subsidy, Nigerians have been thrown into unprecedented hardship, with the price of food items and other commodities increasing almost daily. 






The naira on recently hit N1,900 to a dollar at the parallel market, while at the official market, the naira stood at N1,551.24 to a dollar. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, as of May 2023, the headline inflation rate was 22.41% but it increased and hit a 27-year high as headline inflation rose to 28.9 per cent in December.
However, the National Bureau of Statistics, in its Consumer Price Index published Thursday, revealed that the inflation rate climbed to 29.90 per cent in January 2024, while food prices have continued to increase without end, with costs of essential goods hitting three times high in the market.
For instance, it was gathered that one of the most consumed foods in Nigeria; rice, which used to sell for between N45,000 and N50,000 in November, now costs over N70,000, while noodles formerly sold for between N1,900 and N2,000 now sell for N7,000 to N7,800 in Lagos.      
Also, garri, which was one of the cheapest foods before and was sold for N800 for a paint bucket, is now sold for N2,500. While a bag of beans, which was sold for between N22,000 and N25,000, now sells for between N75,000 and N80,000.
In the same vein, the cost of transportation has astronomically increased as fares at most destinations have tripled since the removal of the petrol subsidy. The price of petrol currently sells between N600 and N650 per litre depending on the filling station. This was before the price increased from N195 per litre.
According to the NBS, the average cost of bus transportation within Nigerian cities rose from N649.59 in May 2023 to N1,285.41 in June 2023 as the pump price of Premium Motor Spirit significantly rose.
The biting economic hardship forced many Nigerians to take to the streets in some cities across the country, protesting against the economic downturn. Protests had broken out in different parts of the country in reaction to the high cost of living, with citizens in Niger, Kano, Kogi, Ondo, and Oyo, among other states demanding solutions to the economic crisis.
Again, The Nigeria Customs Service recently announced the suspension of the sale of foodstuffs following a stampede that reportedly killed seven persons at the NCS Old Zonal Headquarters in the Yaba area of Lagos State. With this, the attempt by the government to find a quick solution to hunger and hardship was stopped.
This was as the National Executive Council of the Nigeria Labour Congress issued a 14-day ultimatum to the Federal Government to implement the October 2, 2023, agreement and address the mounting cost of living crisis in the country. The NLC also declared a two-day national protest on February 27 and 28 to register their outrage at the frightening level of hardship and lingering security challenges.
Although this was not the first time the Organised Labour had threatened a strike since the removal of the subsidy, it did the same, which was planned to commence on August 2, 2023, but was cancelled after President Bola Tinubu rolled out a list of plans to ease the hardship in a nationwide protest on July 31.        
Efforts of the government
In the broadcast, the President said his government had saved over N1tn within two months of ending the petrol subsidy regime while listing several initiatives to cushion the hardship. The President said his administration would invest N50bn each to cultivate 150 hectares of rice and maize; N50bn each would be earmarked to cultivate 100,000 hectares of wheat and cassava; invest N100bn on or before March 2024 to acquire 3,000 units of 20-seater CNG-fueled buses; collaborate with the labour unions to introduce a new minimum wage for workers; 75 manufacturing enterprises will be able to access N1bn credit at 9% per annum; and to energise the micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises with N125bn.
Others are N50bn on a conditional grant to one million Nano businesses before March 2024; to fund 100,000 MSMEs and start-ups with N75bn; each enterprise promoter to get between N500,000 and N1m in loans at a nine per cent interest rate per annum; to provide 225,000 metric tonnes of fertilizer, seedlings, and other inputs to farmers; and to order the release of 200,000 metric tonnes of grains from strategic reserves to households at moderate prices.”
In line with promises, in August, the Federal Government approved N5bn as a conditional cash transfer palliative to 15 million households for each state and the Federal Capital Territory. The monthly federal allocation to states was also increased to almost double what was received in the past after the subsidy removal.
In January 2024, the President ordered the distribution of palliative items worth N200m to senators and Rep members for onward distribution to their constituencies. In February, Tinubu directed the release of more than 102,000 metric tonnes of various grain types from the National Food Reserve and the Rice Millers Association of Nigeria.
Also, in February, the Bank of Industry revealed that it would be disbursing three categories of funding totaling N200bn to support manufacturers and businesses across the country.
CSOs, experts react      
Despite the efforts of the government, civil society organisations and stakeholders have argued that no positive results have been achieved as the hardship in the country worsens daily.
Speaking on the matter, the Chairman of the Rivers State Civil Society Organisation, Enefa Georgewill, said, “If government policy is yielding positive results, we would have been seeing signs of it. Rather, what we are seeing is that things are getting worse; people are getting poorer, and people are getting hungrier. Companies are also collapsing. We are not seeing any visible signs that things will get better because they are getting worse by the day.”
He criticised the APC governments under Buhari and Tinubu, describing them as “directionless.” According to him, it is a wrong decision to remove the petrol subsidy in a country that cannot provide a stable electricity supply. Petrol and other related products are the energy life wire of Nigeria and that is why, immediately after they removed the subsidy on petrol, they increased the cost of everything in the country. And what is happening is a reflection of what we said before.”  Related News  Tinubu may announce new minimum wage on Workers’ Day  Tinubu felicitates UBA chair, Elumelu, at 61  Buy made-in-Nigeria goods to strengthen naira, Tinubu urges Nigerians   
He stated further that the subsidy removal policy had only succeeded in inflicting more hardship on the people, saying it had “made Nigeria poorer and disempowered. And until it is reverted, we are going to go down deeper in the poverty line.
Georgewill, however, wants the Federal Government to invest “heavily” in energy to ensure it is sustainable.
According to him, if Dangote could say about 30 per cent of their production cost is consumed by energy, one can imagine what small enterprises are confronted with. He also enjoined the Tinubu-led government to invest in agriculture for food security.
He added, “It is a shame that Nigeria cannot utilise its arable lands to feed itself and boost the economy and we are saying that the Federal Government should immediately declare a state of emergency on agriculture so that there would be food sufficiency.”  
Also, the founder of the Act for Positive Transformative Initiative, Tolulope Babaleye, described the initiative adopted to cushion the effect of the subsidy removal as a “widow-guessing solution.”
According to him, the removal of the subsidy, which has thrown all Nigerians into hardship, was a “mistake” by the president, who was unaware that he had been led into a “trap” by former President Buhari.
“I think the President made a mistake in just announcing the removal of subsidy on the very day he was sworn in without finding out the actual situation of things. I believe the last government must have hidden some things from him. Nobody knew Nigeria’s economy would be as bad as this. It was like a moving trap.”
He, however, said that the steps that have been taken by the government require patience and that with time, they could yield the expected result.
He added, “I pity the president because Nigeria seems to have lost their patience. And if something drastic is not done between now and a few months, I am afraid there may be a replica of the Arab Spring because the situation is very tough.
“Everything has a divided solution because the economy is fully dependent on importation. And any economy that depends on importation would have its currency decline in the world market and that is what is happening to us. For us to get to that level, we have to have a productive economy. How? We must have power and electricity because this determines most things.”
Also, the Director General of the Presidential Campaign Council of the Peoples Democratic Party in Kwara State, Dr Mahmud Ajeigbe, said, “Every government comes in with policies they believe will drive the economy of the country. I am not so sure about the dynamics in which some of these policies were set up because a government that has been in power for nine months is going down. I am not sure where we can point out that the problem lies because it is a tough one.”      
He also said it was easy to accuse the previous government of not governing well, which was what led to the current situation, but the failure of the government to provide relevant information on the situation of things has contributed to a great extent to the nation’s predicament.
He said the current hardship started with the deregulation of fuel prices, which had continued to worsen the costs of goods and services.
“I think the major problem is that there has not been good information on what is going on or if they have an idea of where this will get to with all these things falling apart. What I have seen is that every month is now worse than the previous month. It is tough.
“For me, this is beyond politics because it affects everybody, whether you are APC, PDP, or anyone else. I don’t know what exactly they are expecting to achieve with whatever they are doing. What I know is that if you do certain things, you will expect certain results. Is this what they were expecting to happen? If yes, what are we expecting to happen next?”
On his part, the Vice Chairman of the Kwara State PDP, Abraham Amah, said Nigerians would not have been facing the current hardship if Buhari had revived the refineries as promised during his campaign in 2015.
He advised the Federal Government to open the borders for the importation of cement, rice, and other important commodities to end the monopoly within a certain period of years, which would crash the market prices. According to him, crisis looms if the government does not address the situation in a few months, saying the situation will deteriorate as many families will no longer have the capacity to pay house rents and cater for themselves.
“I think that the steps that the President needs to take right now are to open the importation of cement. We cannot continue to leave these things in the hands of a few individuals, at least for a window period of two years, to allow his policies to stabilise so that within this period, rice and other basic items can be affordable. They should allow more people to participate in the importation of cement, rice, and flour. It will go a long way towards ameliorating the suffering of Nigerians.        
“Nigerians cannot afford rice at N80,000. The minimum wage is N30,000, but despite that, most states are not paying it. How will people then cope? If these things are not taken care of, we are going to face more challenges. Firstly, many people will not be able to pay their rent because the cost of rent will increase. After all, the cost of building materials is also increasing consistently.”
He, however, urged the President to engage more technocrats to work and fast-track the process of resolving these economic crises.
Supporting Amah’s view, an economist and Professor of Economics at the University of Uyo, Edet Akpakpan, urged the President to assemble experts who would proffer solutions and guide in the implementation of the solutions.
He, however, disagrees with the PDP vice chairman’s position on allowing for importation, saying Nigeria must reduce the level of demand for the dollars. Akpakpan also stated that most of the increase in the prices of commodities was “artificial”, adding that the rate of insecurity rate in the country has affected the country’s production line, thereby causing food scarcity.
He said, “Some of the increases in some of the commodities are artificial; part of it is what has happened to production. Production has shrunken because of insecurity. Food insecurity is affected by the prevailing security situation in the country and whoever manages to have the food in stock will take the prices up.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/16234209/TINUBU-AND-CARDOSO.jpg
politics,"Resign if you're desperate to replace Abure, LP replies NLC president",The leadership crisis rocking the Labour Party took a different dimension on Saturday after the National Working Committee of the opposition party accused the National President of Nigeria Labour Cong...,16th March 2024,https://punchng.com/resign-if-youre-desperate-to-replace-abure-lp-replies-nlc-president/,Adebayo Folorunsho-Francis,"The leadership crisis rocking the Labour Party took a different dimension on Saturday after the National Working Committee of the opposition party accused the National President of Nigeria Labour Congress, Joe Ajaero, of desperately seeking to replace its National Chairman, Julius Abure.
The allegation was a response to an open letter written on Friday by the political wing of the NLC, the Nigeria Labour Congress Political Commission.
In the letter jointly signed by the Chairman and Secretary of the commission, Titus Amba and Chris Uyot, Abure and the NWC were accused of proposing a ‘secret’ national convention in Umuahia, Abia State capital on March 27 that will re-elect Abure to continue running the Labour Party as a ‘sole administrator.’
While stating that the circular was passed without the input of stakeholders, especially the NLC, the letter also alleged that Abure had in April 2023 tried to extend his tenure in office by two years unilaterally but was stopped at the instance of the party’s presidential candidate, Peter Obi, who insisted that the right thing be done. 






Describing the planned convention as illegal, the political wing of the NLC called for the immediate resignation of Abure as the party chairman and the constitution of a caretaker transition committee to organise a legitimate and all-inclusive national convention for the party.
But the leadership of LP kicked against the directive which it claimed was being orchestrated by Ajaero over his alleged ambition to become the next national chairman of the party.
Reacting in a statement titled ‘Resign as NLC President to Contest LP Chairmanship, Labour Party advises Joe Ajero,’ the National Publicity Secretary of LP, Obiora Ifoh, said the leadership of the party will not take order from unionists who are not card-carrying members of their party.      
Ifoh also stated that the said national convention planned to be held in Umuahia on March 27 will go on as planned.
He said, “The attention of the leadership of the Labour Party has been drawn to a press 4elease titled ‘A misadventure in political mischief, mismanagement and misdemeanour gone too far’ written by the NLC’s Political Commission as an agent of the Nigeria Labour Congress. The NLC letter did not come to us as a surprise or a shock. It was long expected before now, having known that the NLC was going to engage itself in this misadventure.  Related News  APGA knocks Ganduje over comment on Anambra state  LP national chairman planning to suspend Obi – Embattled treasurer  Wabba tackles Abure, says  NLC owns Labour Party   
“Nigerians will recall that in 2014, NLC has been involved in a war of blackmail and attrition against the Labour Party and its leadership. It was only recently, following the civil and diplomatic approach adopted by Julius Abure when he assumed leadership that he was able to get the then President of the NLC, Ayuba Waba, and the then President of the Trade Union Congress, Olaleye Quadri, to a truce where the NLC, TUC and Labour Party agreed to work together in harmony.
“Unfortunately, the rascality of the current president of the NLC, Joe Ajero, has destroyed the successes already recorded. It must be noted that the NLC and its political commission have become a bundle of contradiction and paradox. The Nigeria Labour Congress has written several letters to the Independent National Electoral Commission and to the party on the need to conduct a national convention.”
Continuing, the LP spokesman stated that the leadership of the party eventually yielded to the agitation for the national convention, which was fully backed by Article 14:4b of the party Constitution.
Ifoh added that if the NLC president and his loyalists are not contented with the provision, Ajaero should be advised to quit his position and officially join the race to wrest power from Abure.
He however urged the unionists to consider becoming members of the party at ward level as genuine politicking starts from the grassroots.        
“At this point, the leadership of the party wants to ask the NLC, what exactly do they want? If Joe Ajero is interested in the leadership of the party, he is therefore advised to resign as the President of the NLC and join in the contest for the National Chairmanship of the party that is scheduled for the convention on the 27th of March, 2024.
“We have advised the NLC before now that party politics is played at the ward level and not at the national level. If NLC is interested in taking the leadership of the party, it should go and engage in the mass mobilisation of its members to join the party at the grassroots. It will shock Nigerians to know that members and officials of the NLC are not even card-carrying members of the Labour Party. All over the country, NLC members are supporting either the APC or the PDP.
“We must note that undue interference by the Nigeria Labour Congress on the affairs of the party has become worrisome and it has become needful to emphasise here the distinction that the Labour Party has a life of its own different from that of the Nigeria Labour Congress. We therefore want to advise the NLC and its commission that it should focus only on its statutory responsibilities of defending the workers and the workers’ rights.
“In conclusion, we note that the Labour Party will be going ahead with our party programmes and our convention will be held. We have consulted with our stakeholders and the consultation is ongoing and we will continue to consult until March 27 when the new leadership of the party will emerge,” he stated.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/04185755/Joe-Ajaero.jpg

The Nigerian federal system has been a subject of debate among intellectuals, commentators, lawyers, and media practitioners since the end of the military rule in 1999. From local to the centre, the Nigerian brand of federalism has thrown up a lot of questions than answers.
Unlike what obtains in other climes with an emphasis on strong regions and a weak centre, the nation’s variant of federalism makes for a strong centre and weak federating components. As a result, developmental needs of the people which ordinarily should have been undertaken at the local and sub-national levels are left on the table of the Federal Government. In most cases, these needs are either poorly attended to or not attended to at all.
But for eminent Nigerians privileged to witness to the take-off of the Nigerian state in the 60s, life wasn’t as hellish as it is today. The era (1960-1966) saw Nigeria experimenting with the parliamentary system of government. A byproduct of British imperialism, this was not unexpected as Great Britain had from inception adopted that model of government. 






In the past few decades, eminent Nigerians including the likes of the late Governor of Kaduna State, Balarabe Musa, Nobel Laureate, Prof Wole Soyinka, ex-United Nations Secretary General, Emeka Anyaoku, legal luminary, Mike Ozekhome, and a host of others, at different times, called for the discontinuation of the presidential system and a return to the parliamentary model.
Last week, 60 members of the House of Representatives led by the Minority Leader, Kingsley Chinda, presented some bills aimed at amending relevant provisions of the 1999 Constitution to enable the country to transit from the presidential to the parliamentary system of government. The same week, they (60 members) commenced consultation on the proposed amendment, stressing that the cost of governance occasioned by the presidential system does not augur well for a country like Nigeria that is struggling to match her resource endowment with real development.
Addressing a press conference at the National Assembly Complex, Abuja, the spokesman for the sponsors and member representing Kebbe/Tambuwal Constituency, Sokoto State, Abdulssamad Dasuki, said that when passed, the parliamentary system would significantly impact the national political landscape.      
He said, “Our founders in their wisdom and a political atmosphere devoid of compulsion and having considered the interests of their native peoples and their desire to live together in a country where truth and justice reign, where no man is oppressed, and where all citizens live in peace and plenty, adopted the parliamentary system of government.
“That was the governance system of the First Republic, a period when legislative and executive powers were exercised by the representatives of the people in parliament and the executive, and by the nature of the system, these representatives were accountable to the people.”
While proponents of the continuation of the presidential system argued that the system was more representative and thus better suited for Nigeria, owing to her diversity; the conversation in favour of a parliamentary system had been that it remained cost-effective and accountable to the people.
If Nigerians vote in favour of the parliamentary model, citizens will for the first time in decades live with the reality of the fusion of powers as against the separation of powers that is the hallmark of the presidential system.
As the lawmakers take their proposal to the courts of Nigerians for their input in the constitutional amendment process, renowned politician, essayist, and political administrator, Prof Iyorwuese Hagher, has called on the lawmakers not to waste their energy in pursuit of what he sees as a mission fated to fail from the outset.
In an exclusive interview with Saturday PUNCH, Hagher said, “I sympathise with the group of lawmakers seeking an amendment to the 1999 Constitution to pave the way for a transition to the parliamentary system of government. They should be consoled because this effort will be fruitless.
“The country is in dire need of patriotic Nigerians in leadership positions who are not swayed by corruption to feed their appetites and acquire material things, or by ethnic identities that fuel ethnic-racist resentments against other ethnic nationalities.        
“The 1999 Constitution was a deliberate political engineering to create a national consensus, especially for the recruitment of the president, who in the parliamentary system did not need the acceptance or recognition beyond the Federal Constituency.”
While admitting that the system is prone to corruption, Hagher insisted that what Nigeria needed was not to jettison the model but to muster the courage to make leadership more responsive to the yearnings of Nigerians.
He continued, “We have now tasted the presidential system and found it to be a corruption-infested, dollar-dependent, faceless, and ruthless engine of political oppression. The presidential system has far too much power invested in the president and governors, leaving the public a pathetic derelict on the margin of political actions.
“The political parties are now the winnowing fans of the executives, who have de-gutted the power of the party. Superfluously, the governors and even the Nigerian President proudly refer to themselves as “Chief Executives,” instead of constitutional presidents or governors, as in the Americas where the presidential systems have been tried, tested, and adjusted to fit the political culture and political clime.
“What Nigeria needs is not to swing back to the parliamentary system. That is merely going back to gobble our effluvium. Nigeria needs a committed and dynamic leadership, that puts Nigeria first and everything about Nigeria. We must severely punish economic saboteurs as a deterrent, and uproot the corrupt civil servants, who enable corruption and deal decisively to overhaul the banking sector, including the Central Bank of Nigeria. This is the overriding need and agenda that cannot wait. Systems and forms of government can wait, but the need for new leadership and new vision cannot wait.”
Continuing, the professor of Theatre for Development added that Nigeria “needs a courageous leadership that says no to both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and protects the little food the poor masses put on the floor to eat at the end of the day. Nigeria will continue to fail to grow if we retain our devilish attachment to the market forces of Western neo-liberalism dictated by the IMF and the World Bank.”
To help make political leadership more accountable to the people, Hagher called for a single term of six years for the Nigerian president and five years for state governors.

On his part, media trainer, Emman Shehu, expressed doubt about the suitability of the parliamentary system in the nation’s political setup.
“My problem with such changes is that we do not allow for stability within our polity. What is the guarantee that after going back to the parliamentary system, we will not be advocating for a return to the presidential system when faced with a new set of unforeseen problems? Those we have borrowed both systems from have endured with a preferred system and allowed each challenge to become a means of refining the system.
“The most important thing at this point is to identify the downsides in our current system and find a way of overcoming them. It is clear to everyone that there is a need to ruthlessly cut the cost of governance in every way possible. The second thing to do is to make political representation a part-time affair, and in this way, only people who have a genuine passion for representing the people will bother to run for office. At the moment, it has become a place for all manner of people with zero understanding of sincere governance principles. For most, it is just a profession and an easy way of becoming financially well-to-do,” he said.
Taking a different position is Nigeria’s former minister of Education, Prof Tunde Adeniran, who argued that what the country needed was a new constitution and not an amendment to the current one.
“We need a new constitution to be determined by the Nigerian people, following global best practices. Let the people themselves decide through a referendum. They know what they want,” he said.
Meanwhile, good governance advocate and founder, Women Arise, Joe Okei-Odumakin, said Nigeria witnessed an unprecedented level of development when she experimented with the parliamentary system on the attainment of political independence in 1960.
In her words, “Parliamentary system of government is not entirely new to Nigerian system of governance. Meaningful development occurred during the era of the parliamentary system of government in Nigeria which was truncated by the Aguiyi Ironsi-led coup on January 15, 1966.  
“Countries like Britain, Germany, Japan, and others are governed through a parliamentary system of government. Aside from the peculiarities of Nigerians’ way of doing things in a way that doesn’t align with the interest of the greater good of the people, without consequence for such misdemeanours, parliamentary governance is better than the subsisting presidential system of government in Nigeria.”
A former member of the House of Representatives, Ihuoma Ngozika, in his contribution, noted that the problem with Nigeria was not essentially the system of government but in the political actors who ended up making a mess of the same.
He said, “Both systems work in sane climes. The problems here are the operators. They are our biggest problem; confused lawmakers!”
Joining the conversation is a respected voice in northern Nigeria, Anthony Sani, who argued that the problem with good governance in the land stemmed from the pervasive corruption of leaders across different layers of government.
Sani, a chieftain of the Arewa Consultative Forum, in a telephone interview with Saturday PUNCH, said, “I have stated times and again that no form of government can work successfully without changing our corrupt attitude and the way we do things. Our problems have nothing to do with the form of government or with the structure of the country because Nigeria has practised all forms of government; be it a parliamentary, military dictatorship, or now the presidential system, all of which work in other climes.
“The presidential system has worked for Americans, the parliamentary form for the British, and the combination of the two works well for French people. When you talk about the cost of the presidential system, note that the United States has about 25 ministers, Britain has 17, France has 15 but Nigeria has a crowd called government. In Nigeria, we appoint advisers even in areas that have ministries with professionals who can advise the government. Some state governors appoint over 1,000 special assistants who do nothing.”
Continuing, Sani maintained, “America which is bigger and richer than Nigeria has nine Supreme Court Justices while we have 21; the US Vice President is the same as the Senate President, just to reduce the cost and improve the relationship between the executive and legislative arms of governments. Our ways of doing things are what is expensive and not the presidential government.      
“We have restructured several times, be it geo-political or economic models. We have tasted both state capitalism and privatization and like I said before, these forms and structures work well in other climes. Our challenges are the collapse of national ideals, moral values, and the sense of what is right and wrong, and these challenges can be overcome through cultural renaissance and social justice.
On his part, constitutional lawyer and rights activist, Abdul Mahmud, noted that the parliamentary model of government will better meet the needs of Nigerians In his words, “The parliamentary system is most suited for plural, cultural and ethno-heterogeneous state-nations where differences are accentuated not only by agitations for power, which in many instances are internecine but by the very nature of the state-nation which seeks to maintain the different cultural boundaries as its own.
“In our experience, we have seen how the winner-takes-all presidential system makes power-sharing, for instance, difficult. Secondly, the parliamentary system is cost-effective. It dispenses with the cost attendant to national elections in which the president and governors are elected through expensive national and local elections.
“Under the parliamentary system, all elections are local as national leaders are first elected as parliamentarians representing local constituencies. They are then elected as leaders of the majority party in parliament. More importantly, the parliamentary system allows for the growth of political parties that are the engine rooms of parliamentary democracy. A political party that seeks to capture the position of the Prime Minister must be able to organise within itself, democratise itself, and prime its internal organs to win majority seats in the national parliament. The parliamentary system makes all politics local.”
While commending the 60 lawmakers for their bold steps, Mahmud urged them to “Look at our historical constitutional experiences between 1954 and 1966, with particular attention paid to the 1960 and 1963, and adopt some of their essential provisions that made the parliamentary system effective before the 1966 military putsch,” he added.
As the lawmakers insisted that they would take the campaign to every part of the nation ahead of the commencement of the constitutional amendment process, Chinda maintained that only Nigerians would decide the fate of the bills, stressing that the 60 legislators had done their part.
“Consultation is ongoing. It is only a bill in line with our thoughts and mandate to make laws for the peace and development of our country. Nigerians have the final say and will decide on the way forward. It’s not a contest,” he said.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/13142131/Akpabio-1.jpg
politics,Yar’Adua replaces Ningi as Northern senators forum chairman,"Forty-eight hours after the resignation of suspended Senator Abdul Ningi (PDP Bauchi Central) as Chairman of the Northern Senators’ Forum, Senator Abdulaziz Yar’Adua (APC Katsina Central),...",14th March 2024,https://punchng.com/yaradua-replaces-ningi-as-northern-senators-forum-chairman/,Tope Omogbolagun,"Forty-eight hours after the resignation of suspended Senator Abdul Ningi (PDP Bauchi Central) as Chairman of the Northern Senators’ Forum, Senator Abdulaziz Yar’Adua (APC Katsina Central), emerged as the new Chairman.
Yar’Adua’s emergence as the new Chairman of the NSF was a sequel to unanimous endorsement to that effect by senators across the three geo-political zones in the North.
The Northern senators also appointed Senator Mohammed Monguno (APC, Borno North) as Publicity Secretary of the forum, a position held by Senator Summaila Kawu (NNPP Kano South) when Ningi was the Chairman.
It is unclear if Kawu resigned too or if he was removed following the crisis at the Red Chamber on Tuesday. 






Addressing the press after his emergence as the new chairman of NSF, Yar ‘ Adua said the major objective of the Northern Forum was to promote the interest of Nigeria first, followed by the development of the North through collaboration with their counterparts from the South and cooperating with the executive arm of government to ensure that the challenges of the region are attended to.
Yar’Adua said, “We shall therefore work in consultation with our distinguished colleagues to preserve the unity and progress of our dear nation.
“In advancing these noble objectives, I am committed to streamlined activities within the Northern Senators Forum.

“We shall operate with transparency, accountability, and integrity, upholding the trust placed on us by the electorate. “
He added, “Our legislative discourse will continue to be characterized by civility, dignity, and adherence to the rule of law as we fulfil our lawmaking, policy-making, and oversight functions.
“I am confident that with our collective efforts and cooperation, we can effect positive change, uplift the North, and contribute to the overall development of our great nation.”
Earlier in his acceptance speech to his fellow Northern Senators for the honour done him, Senator Yar’Adua said, “I am deeply honoured and humbled to communicate to you today my acceptance as the Chairman of the Northern Senators Forum.
“I extend my heartfelt gratitude to my distinguished colleagues for this vote of confidence in me following the resignation of my distinguished elder brother Senator Abdul Ningi whom I hold in high esteem. I wish to acknowledge and commend the decent outing and the contributions he made during his tenure.
“I am aware of the challenges facing the Northern region which Include: Security, agriculture, education, healthcare, drug abuse human trafficking etc,  which will be tackled with more vibrant legislation in collaboration with our southern counterparts .”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/14212637/Senator-Abdulaziz-YarAdua.jpg

Ogbeide-Ihama, a two-time House of Representatives member under the PDP, was on Tuesday tipped to become the running mate to the APC governorship candidate, Monday Okpebholo.
It was gathered later that top leaders of the APC and the PDP particularly members of the Legacy Group in Edo State loyal to the PDP Vice Chairman, South-South, Chief Dan Orbih and some other leaders like the Minister of the FCT, Nyesome Wike, were meeting at the Abuja residence of the leader of the APC in Edo State, Adams Oshiomhole, to finalise the move.
However, the State Publicity Secretary of the APC, Peter Uwadiae, on Tuesday denied that such a move was going on. 






He said, “There is no truth in that. Ogbeide-Ihama is in the PDP, how can a PDP man be the running mate to our governorship candidate? We don’t even need to react to that because he is not a member of our party. As of today, Ogbeide-Ihama is in PDP until a person is a member of APC, he cannot be talking about being a running mate, we are not looking beyond our party to get a running mate for our candidate.”
Speaking further, Otsu said politics is based on personal and collective interest and no one can stop Ogbeide-Ihama from making his choice.  Related News  Impeachment: Shaibu to paste court papers on Obaseki’s office  CJ has seven days to set up panel on Shaibu -Edo assembly  Promote exports to tackle forex crisis, Obaseki tells FG   
He said, “Politics is about who gets what, when, why, how and that is based on personal or collective interest. If Ogbeide-ihama feels it politically good to become a running mate to Okpebholo, it is within his right and the party cannot stop him. It is an individual decision and if any member of the party or group decides to align with him, it there choice.      
“But you see, the reason why this is coming up if it is true, is that there seems to be no end to the disequilibrium that Governor Godwin Obaseki has instituted in the PDP. After all the stress we have been through in congresses and primaries, there were moves to find a way to align the party. Even the candidate, Asue Ighodalo made a move in that direction.
“But if nothing is being done positively in reuniting the party with the Legacy Group and others, then you cannot blame any member of the party for any decision taken and a disunited PDP cannot with the governorship election in the state.
“It is not good for any party to lose an individual, not to talk of a two-time House of Representatives member. It is not good for the party but it is happening because there seems to be no end in sight for true reconciliation.
“By Thursday, the tenure of the PDP exco in the state comes to an end and the National Working Committee of the party as regards the way forward, has not said anything,” he added.
When contacted Ogbeide-Ihama promised to call the reporter back which he didn’t do as at the time of filling the report. He also did not take several calls to his phone thereafter.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/22123529/Omoregie-Ogbeide-Ihama.jpg

Both Akpabio and Fubara spoke during the funeral service held at the Redeemed Christian Church of God, in Isiokpo.
While the APC, the main opposition party in the state accused the governor of bringing in politics at the funeral, the ruling PDP berated Akpabio over his reactions to the Fubara’s comments.
The Chairman, Rivers State APC Caretaker Committee, Chief Tony Okocha, at a news briefing on Tuesday said all Fubara was expected to do was to give a tribute rather than introducing politics at such a solemn ceremony. 






Okocha stated, “The same fifth columnist that are encouraging him (Fubara) to disobey Mr President, are on a new spree of casting aspersions, deriding the Senate President of Nigeria.
“A burial ceremony, if you have opportunity to speak, you are expected to do a tribute. Even when you want to sing what they call a dirge, you don’t introduce politics.
“The governor goes to Isiokpo, by protocol he was allowed to speak, tribute to the dead. The corpses were lying there. What did he do? A minute after he even started, he veered off; saying ‘I’m talking about the political class. Why are we killing and burying.?’      
“Why is he interested in unnecessary public campaign validation? Come to think of it. Was Wigwe a politician? That population there that day, were they all politicians? Was that a political campaign ground? So he could have said anything without dragging in the political class.
“Its the reason the Senate President, when he took the stage said ‘What are you struggling for? If you don’t want it don’t struggle for it.’ He was passing a message.”
While taking a swipe at the state chapter of the PDP for attacking the Senate President, Okocha said it shows the kind of politics being played in the state.
“The ground you are was not a ground to play politics. But what we are hearing now is that they are abusing him (Akpabio).
“Well, it is their business, but Akpabio is a member of my party. I saw a stupidly written script by the PDP that Akpabio is an enemy of the state and that they will soon declare him a persona non-grata. I laughed. That is the stupidity of the system,” he added.

But the State Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Sydney Gbara, in a statement described Akpabio as an enemy of Rivers, following his recent utterances issued concerning the state.
Gbara alleged that Akpabio was angry due to the applause that greeted Fubara’s remarks on why politicians are fighting and killing over power.        
Gbara stated, “It is now obvious that the Senate President, Senator Godswill Akpabio, is an enemy of Rivers people, as evident in his past and present actions and utterances on issues concerning the state.
“The applause from sympathisers and mourners at the burial, however, drew the anger of Senator Akpabio who mounted the rostrum afterwards to fight, after narrating a concocted fallacious story between him and a former Deputy Governor of Akwa Ibom State over a power struggle, attempted to ridicule Governor Fubara by asking him to resign if there was no need to struggle to kill for power.
“Akpabio had consistently shown disdain, unimaginable level of disrespect and hatred for His Excellency, Siminialayi Fubara, Governor of Rivers State through his utterances at public functions in the state.
“His actions against Rivers people had never been pleasant but embarrassing, as he seems to have taken advantage of the political impasse in the state to perfect his evil enterprise of igniting more crises to the detriment of the state.”
The state PDP spokesman recalled that at a church service recently in Tai Local Government Area of the state, “The same Akpabio had made a ridiculous remark regarding the 2027 Governorship election in Rivers State
“Such a statement was a huge embarrassment which could provoke a crisis as the governor has not told anyone that he would not seek reelection in 2027.
“The PDP therefore uses this medium to advise Senator Akpabio to refrain from verbal attacks on the Executive Governor of Rivers State,, Sir Siminialayi Fubara, as the people of the state would no longer take for granted, such comments capable of further dividing the people”.      
The PDP also warned that if however, Akpabio decides to continue to make negative unprovoked utterances against Fubara, he may not be welcomed into the state again.
The PDP appealed to President Bola Tinubu to call Akpabio to order, saying “His consistent throwing of tantrums at the state governor and the people is capable of provoking crisis in the state.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/12163959/Siminalayi-Fubara-Godswill-Akpabio.jpg

He assured Nigerians that Tinubu has Nigeria on his mind.
This was as he said the government would neither deny the challenges in the country nor apportion blame, but rather accept responsibility and find solutions.
The Vice President made the statement during his remark at a book launch, titled “Beating all Odds: Diaries and Essays on how Bola Tinubu became President”, written by Sam Omatseye, Chairperson of the Editorial Board of The Nation Newspaper, on Tuesday. 






Shettima, who was Special Guest of Honour at the occasion, described Tinubu as “a man of courage and conviction”, noting that the President “took the bull by the horns”, by withdrawing the fuel subsidy and collapsing the multiple exchange rates regime.
The Vice President said, “Be rest assured that the President has Nigeria in his mind. Yes, we are having challenges, we are not denying that, and we are not here to apportion blame.

“Oil subsidy had been an albatross around the neck of the Nigerian economy and the Nigerian nation. He took the bull by the horns and withdrew the fuel subsidy from day one.

In his goodwill message, Senate President Godswill Akpabio, who was represented by Special Adviser, Legal and Constitutional Matters, Dr Monday Ubani, while hailing the qualities of the President outlined in the book, urged Nigerians to support the President.

The Independent National Electoral Commission has fixed April 2024 for the party’s primaries ahead of the forthcoming governorship primary in November, but the national leadership of the APC is yet to fix an exact date for the April primary of the party.
Oke, who spoke during his visit to the state secretariat of the party in Akure, the state capital, on Monday, expressed confidence that he would emerge the candidate of the party after the primary.
He said, “I have come here today to notify you of my intention to throw in my cap again into the contest for the governorship seat of Ondo State on the platform of APC. 






“All I have come here to ask for is not to ask you to descend to the arena but to organise a free and fair primary. Once this is done, we will all go to the field and I assure you I know I will emerge. But in any circumstance, I will remain a loyal party member.”
Oke would be contesting for the primary of the party alongside other aspirants who include, Governor Lucky Aiyedatiwa, a former Commissioner for Finance Mr Wale Akinterinwa, a former member of the House of Representatives, Mr Mayowa Akinfolarin; a former Secretary to the State Government, Mrs Oladunni Odu and a former Special Adviser to Governor Akeredolu on Health, Prof Francis Faduyile.

Oke, who had contested the governorship election twice with the Peoples Democratic Party and the defunct Alliance for Democracy in 2012 and 2020 respectively, declared that he was ready to serve the state if voted for.
“Ondo needs a governor that is familiar with the environment. I have spent the whole of my life in Ondo state, I’ve never been away for six months except in 1971 when I was in Lagos for nine months. I have been part of the suffering, I’ve been part of the denial and that’s why I will be part of the solution to the problems of our state.
“I’ve contested for this position three times, I lost like Buhari and the fourth time is my turn. Recall that three of us rose at the same time in this state. Mimiko, Akeredolu and I. The three of us are from three senatorial districts. Mimiko took his turn from the central senatorial district, and Akeredolu took his turn from the north. I am told and I’m glad that the ticket is shifting to the south, so who’s turn is next? It is my turn! I am the only one who can say that, nobody else can say that Oke stated.
Responding, the National Chairman of the state APC, Mr Ade Adetimehin, urged the aspirants not to take the primary as a do-or-die affair, saying all the aspirants would still come back as members of the same party after the primary.
“We want to appeal to you and your supporters to play the game according to the rules in a civilized way. We should not fight. Don’t be involved in the campaign of bitterness. What I want from you is to focus on how to develop the state.

The coordinators represent Obio/Akpor, Ogu/Bolo, Port Harcourt City, Opobo/Nkoro, Gokana, Bonny, Ahoada West, Ahoada East, Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni, Oyigbo, Asari-Toru, and Akuku-Toru Local Government Areas.
The former Coordinator in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area, Collins Onunwo, led a delegation of former members of the GDI All Coordinators’ Forum on a solidarity visit to G Fubara at the Government House, Port Harcourt, on Sunday,
They explained that their decision to resign from their positions in GDI to join the Simplified Movement was in the interest of the Rivers people. 






Speaking to newsmen, Onunwo, a former chairman of Obio/Akpor LGA, said the key mission of GDI was to protect, defend and promote the interest of Rivers State and its people.
Onunwo added that having freely given their votes and mandate to Fubara, and affirmed by the Supreme Court, GDI has no other option than to support the governor to succeed.
He promised the determination and dedication of the former GDI coordinators to the success of the policies and programmes of the present administration.      
He stated, “We want the public, Rivers people and all Nigerians to know that GDI is the group founded by the former governor and now Federal Capital Territory Minister, Chief Nyesom Wike. That group brought him to power in 2015 and supported his ambition in 2019. That group is his strength.
“But today, we and our supporters have decided we are no longer members of GDI. The reason is simple: we want to be with Rivers people. Rivers’ interest is paramount.

Continuing, he said, “We have come to join millions of Rivers women, youths, elders, and other well-meaning people who insist that we must protect our votes to sustain democracy.
“Our concern is that we voted for the PDP and Sir Siminalayi Fubara, and we must protect that mandate with all we have”.        
He cautioned those fighting the Chief of Staff, Government House, Dr Edison Ehie, to retrace their steps, or prepare to face the wrath of Rivers youths, women, and elders.

At the meeting were the State Chairman, National Youth Council of Nigeria, Amb Chijioke Ihunwo; and the Special Adviser to the Governor on Power, Solomon Abel Eke; among others.
Fubara was Wike’s anointed candidate in the Peoples Democratic Party, to succeed him as Governor of Rivers State.
Both politicians who were good friends before and even shortly after the election and swearing-in of Fubara, suddenly fell apart, leading to a series of fights between them.
However, Fubara had since declared that his administration was not fighting anybody, but preoccupied with delivering on his mandate of taking care of the needs of the people and protecting the interest of the state.
The governor stated this despite the running battle he had been having with his predecessor and some members of the state House of Assembly.      
He explained that in protecting the interest of the state, his administration will continue to do what is right before God and men while encouraging a robust participation of the people in governance.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/02235220/Siminalayi-Fubara-and-Nyesom-Wike.jpeg

Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar in which Muslims all over the world observe fasting for a period of 29 to 30 days.
It involves total abstinence from foods and drinks, from dawn to sunset.
Also, couples are compelled to stay away from sexual intercourse or acts that could lead to romance while fasting, but they are allowed to cohabit in the evening or night of fasting, as stated in the Qur’an 2:187. 






Ramadan is a month for Muslims to reflect and discipline their souls to attain Allah’s forgiveness, mercy and guidance.

Muslims are expected to increase their good deeds during Ramadan and refrain from bad deeds such as gambling, jealousy and gossiping.
In a statement on Monday to mark the beginning of the month, the governor said the fasting period should serve as a time for soulful reflection, devotion, prayers and care for one another.      
He said, “As Muslim faithful embark on Ramadan, I implore you to uphold the virtues of Islam by showing love and compassion to all. It is a time to show good neighbourliness and extend a helping hand to the needy in society, especially in these trying times.
“The Ramadan season is coming at a time when many people are faced with dire economic challenges. It is best to show love during this period as we approach the period solemnly.
“Ramadan provides us an opportunity to bond and show love to our friends and acquaintances and the current season calls for such.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/16224157/OBASEKI.jpg

Nigeria’s economy has suffered severe stagnation since the 1980s. There are two schools of thought to Nigeria’s poor economic situation; while Eurocentric literature blames the civil war and poor leadership in the country, the Afrocentric literature dates Nigeria’s economic distress to the era of colonial suppression and economic exploitation.
However, none of these thought lines relates the policies of the International Monetary Fund to Nigeria’s failing economy.
There is a common saying that he who pays the piper calls the tune. The same can be said of the interference of the International Monetary Fund with Nigeria’s economy and policies. The IMF is the world’s focal organisation responsible for international monetary cooperation. It is otherwise seen as the United Nations autonomous and specialized agency saddled with the responsibility of fostering stability and economic growth globally. 






Conceptualized in the UN-sponsored Monetary and Financial Conference in Breton Woods, New Hampshire, it was created in 1946 with 46 members. The IMF has incorporated 193 countries as of the last count.
It was birthed to prevent another strike of the great economic depression that occurred in the 1920s and 1930s.
Nigeria’s journey to agency       
In March 1961, Nigeria joined the IMF train, a development that occurred just a few months after its independence.
IMF mandates
The IMF handbook declares it has six mandates geared towards the economic stability and prosperity of its member states.
One of the key roles of the IMF is the surveillance over members’ economic policies, financing temporary balance of payments, combating poverty in low-income countries, mobilising external financing, strengthening the international monetary system and increasing the global supply of international reserves, building capacity through technical assistance and training and dissemination of information and research.
Expectedly, the IMF is to lead economic reforms by promoting prudent macroeconomic policies, structural reforms in areas such as exchange rate and tax policy, and issues related to fiscal management, budget execution, fiscal transparency, tax and customs administration.
“The policy of the IMF is of two folds; policies mandatory for members, and assistance policies. Policies mandatory for members are those rules every country must observe as a member which include the IMF Articles of Agreement, quota subscriptions, refrain from restrictions on exchange of foreign currency, and openness in economic policies affecting other countries,” the handbook stated.
The assistant policies include loans or conditional lending and providing economic advice.        
Some economists have argued that the content of the conditionality has been the most controversial output of any intergovernmental organisation.
A professor of Political Economy and Sociology, Alexandros Kentikelenis stated that “for the first four decades of its operations, IMF’s conditionality included a set of predictable reforms that focused almost exclusively on budget deficit reductions, restrictive monetary policy, and exchange rate devaluations.”
The IMF has embarked on several programmes and the most common among them are the Standby Arrangement, 1952, and the Extended Fund Facility, 1974, both of which were designed to provide short-term-balance of payment assistance to member countries.
Economists Robert Barro and Jong-Whan Lee stated, “The IMF replaced the SBA (Small Business Administration) and EFF with the Structural Adjustment Facility 1986 and the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility 1987 owing to the shortcomings of the former.
Agency’s programmes in Nigeria 
In Nigeria, the IMF has adopted and implemented a policy and programme referred to as the Structural Adjustment Programme otherwise known as (Washington Consensus) with its consequent loan conditionality. Although Nigeria has been a member of the IMF since 1961, it is believed that it was only in 1986 that the IMF established a stronghold in the country and began the policies that have been hazardous to the country.
Nigeria, the chorused giant of Africa, was purely an agrarian economy until the discovery of oil in Oloibiri, the present Bayelsa State by the mid-1960s and fully dependent on crude oil by the 1970s. This new wealth led to the neglect of the other sectors like agriculture, which had hitherto sustained the economy.      
By the 1980s, oil sales dominated the economy accounting for about 80 per cent of the Federal Government’s revenues and 95 per cent of foreign exchange earnings. However, the wide oil glut that occurred between 1980 and 1986 caused a sudden price fall that reduced forex in Nigeria.
An economist, Imimole Benedict said, “The fall in world oil price and the sharp decline in petrol output, the latter resulting from a lowering of Nigeria’s OPEC quota in the early 1980s also brought the country’s economy to the verge of collapse. Against this backdrop, the sudden oil price shock created a balance of payment deficit in Nigeria’s economy.”
He added, “Ranging from her inability to meet her domestic financial obligations to difficulties in servicing her foreign debt, the Nigerian economy shrank. It is this economic difficulty that led to the intervention of IMF in 1986 together with its Structural Adjustment Programme.”
SAP is a set of economic reforms that a country must adhere to in order to secure a loan from the IMF and/or the World Bank. Structural adjustments are often a set of economic policies, including reducing government spending, opening to free trade, and so on.
Prescriptions good on the surface 
Experts have argued that the IMF policy recommendations to Nigeria look good on the surface but have dragged the country into deeper and more abject poverty.
An economic expert, Abdulrauf Aliyu, noted, “Accepting the IMF conditionalities implies economic difficulties; its rejection will as such lead to a parlous economic situation. Indeed, this was no easy choice.  
“The IMF handbook stated that SAP is based on a policy of privatisation and commercialisation of public utilities, removal of subsidies, liberalisation, and self-reliance. It is an economic measure aimed at revamping the economy.
“SAP’s objectives in Nigeria, according to the IMF, are to restructure and diversify the economy by curtailing Nigeria’s over-reliance or dependence on the oil sector thus stimulating the development of non-oil sectors; to curtail inflationary growth to the economy by removing all barriers to effective and efficient trade; to attract foreign direct investment to Nigeria through the adoption and implementation of deregulation and privatisation policies; to create employment opportunities for Nigeria and to reduce public expenditure and entrench prudent financial management of the economy.
“The handbook noted that the IMF prescriptions required fiscal discipline which was lacking among its economic managers. In other words, the conditions became the necessary procedures that were to be adopted by the Nigerian government, and its implementation was supervised and monitored by IMF officials.  Related News  Enugu will generate, distribute electricity by 2026 - Gov  How subsidy removal killed clean cooking  Electricity subsidy removal calls intensify amid rising industry debts   
“The IMF prescriptions were attached with many stringent conditions which accompanied the SAP. These conditions include the rule of the market; cutting public expenditure for social services; deregulation, commercialisation, and privatisation; elimination of public goods; removal of petrol subsidies and the abolition of agricultural marketing boards; devaluation of the naira; staff rationalisation in government ministries, parastatals, and agency.
“It is also possible that the harsh conditions were intended by the IMF to make the military regime in Nigeria unpopular thereby forcing a regime change. Certainly, the loan was a devil’s alternative, and devaluation of the Nigerian currency, was an additional economic burden. Industries, exchange rate, currency devaluation, employment, banking and finance, and oil subsidy were the areas worst hit.”
Recall that the naira devaluation was not a one-time incidence, but rather had been on constant and precarious scales of devaluation. In 1985, the naira exchange rate to the dollar was 90 kobo to $1. However, by 1986 after SAP was introduced, the exchange rate of naira to dollars had increased to N2.02, and by 1999 it had reached N22 to $1.
The naira further depreciated to dollars, falling to N320 to $1 by 2016. The Nigerian economy further contracted in December 2017 when the naira was exchanged at N360 to $1 and recently in February 2024, the dollar was exchanged at N1600/$. This devaluation of the naira as one of IMF’s loan conditionalities led to high inflation rates and lowered purchasing power of many Nigerians.      
Abdulrauf added, “The IMF policies escalated the balance of payment deficit which led to horrendous local currency costs of imported raw materials and intermediate capital goods that in turn orchestrated inflation and necessitated a decrease in living standards.
“The same aftermaths were also present owing to the removal of subsidy which further compounded the problem as subsidy removal increased import bills. This also worsened the position of manufacturing industries which were largely dependent on imported machinery, spare parts, and raw materials.
“Due to currency devaluation and subsidy removal, the Nigerian government had to ban the importation of agricultural goods like rice, maize, wheat, and vegetable oils. Although by obstructing import, there was a slight increase in local output production; significantly in rice, poultry, and fishery products, but these were less profitable because of high costs of imported inputs incurred due to subsidy removal and currency devaluation.
“This resulted in more economic hardship for the ordinary people. An inclusive economic system will in the long run benefit the country more than the previously held stand of extractive economic system. Additionally, deregulation, commercialisation, and privatisation initially compounded the unemployment crisis and enthroned mass poverty. Its socio-economic costs on people could be gleaned from the below.”
He added, “Also, through staff rationalisation of public institutions, many civil servants lost their jobs with an accompanying concomitant cataclysmic consequence of social dislocations: as many breadwinners in families lost their jobs without any social welfare scheme provided by the Nigerian government.
“It also led to civil unrest, riots, and a rise in crime rates. Apart from civil unrest, riots, and a rise in crime rates, privatisation lowered life expectancy and literacy rates among middle and low-income Nigerians.
“Privatisation is to be considered the hallmark of capitalism. This is a pointer to the fact that capitalism is indeed profit-inclined. Once privatised, schools, hotels, firms, and hospitals began to charge unaffordable fees. Due to the high costs of health care and education, many were discouraged from seeking health care in hospitals and furthering their education. This situation led to the proliferation of quack doctors and fake drugs as many could barely afford good hospitals and drugs.”        
In its latest ‘Post Financing and Assessment Discussion and Staff Report’ for Nigeria, the fund suggested a series of measures to be implemented over the next six to 12 months aimed at stabilising the economy and fostering growth.
One of the primary recommendations is to raise the monetary policy rate at the upcoming Monetary Policy Committee meeting to achieve a positive real interest rate.
“Raise the monetary policy rate at the next Monetary Policy Committee meeting to make it positive in real terms over the next six-12 months. This will be a key signal of the direction of monetary policy despite limited transmission. The pace of tightening and the terminal rate can be calibrated from meeting to meeting considering incoming data,” the report stated.
An economist, Femi Oladele, said he believed that Nigeria’s economy would rebound if the country sought indigenous solutions to its economic challenges. He added that external communities couldn’t proffer solutions to problems endemic to the country.
“I believe Nigeria’s failing economy will rebound with ‘insights from the inside’. African solutions cannot be rightly proffered from the outside,” he said.
Lending his voice to the matter, a financial expert, Prof John Alabi, said while the IMF recommendations might appear good from the outside, it had sparked crises in nations of the world and must be thought of critically before embracing and implementing them.
“You’ll realise that because of the universal nature of the IMF prescriptions, it doesn’t consider the local economy. So, nations of the world would have to think twice before implementing their recommendations. While some countries of the world have accepted their recommendations, others have vehemently rejected them.      
“Where policies are recommended, countries should look at the local conditions and see how best they can be implemented, otherwise the prescriptions are violent and can spark up crisis in nations of the world; it can even engender military coup where the military takes over the government,” he said.
He added, “Currently, what we have in Nigeria is an inflationary crisis. The IMF will ask for a free-fall economy, but no country in the world will just leave their economy to experience a free fall. Even in the United States and other developed nations of the world, there are unseen hands that control what happens in the economy.”
Alabi suggested guided deregulation like the introduction of the commodity board, saying, “We cannot just allow the naira to fall freely; the forces of demand and supply cannot just drive the economy. So, the policies of the IMF, as good as they are, must be studied and domesticated in line with the situations in Africa and other developing countries.”
In its latest but harsh recommendation to the government, the fund asked the Federal Government to completely phase out electricity subsidy in the country.
The IMF made the recommendation while advising Nigeria on pathways to restoring macroeconomic stability in its ‘Post Financing Assessment’ report.
Nigeria’s electricity has been subsidized; hence, the power sector is currently not allowed to charge a cost-reflective tariff due to a subsidy paid on electricity by the government.
Up till the third quarter of 2023, Nigeria has spent N204.59bn on electricity subsidy and plans to expend an additional N1.6tn in 2024 to enable citizens to access power at a low cost.      
The IMF noted that fuel and electricity subsidies are costly, do not reach those that most need government support “and should be phased out completely.”
However, taking a look at the impact of the fuel subsidy removal, and the lack of preparedness on the part of the government to cushion the impact on citizens, experts have criticized the move and have said, Nigeria needs to properly study the recommendations of the IMF before implementation.
The Chancellor of the International Society for Social Justice and Human Rights, Jackson Omenazu, said the IMF policies were aimed at impoverishing Africa, adding that the call for electricity subsidy removal was to the advantage of the West than it would benefit Nigerians.
He called on the Nigerian government to resist the IMF and its policy recommendations and develop local solutions to the country’s problems.
“In the current world order and the last 40 years, IMF’s recommendations have not favoured Africa and Nigeria inclusive. It has rather helped in impoverishing the region and enriching Europe and America.
“We don’t need policies from the IMF to run our economy. The recent call on the government to remove electricity subsidy is uncalled for. It is the IMF’s way of making Nigerians import alternative energy should they not be able to afford the new bill. They (the IMF) are banking on the ignorance of the leadership of the nation to carry out the policies to their advantage,” he said.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/09230231/TINUBU.jpg

During the event held at the Government House, Awka, on Wednesday, Soludo commended members of the commission and its chairman, Prof. Chidi Odinkalu, for their “dedication” and “historic” nature of the report.
He stressed that the report has the potential to serve as a national framework for addressing security challenges in the country while expressing deep concern about the impact of crime and violence has caused on young people.
 






He said, “We pledge swift action based on the commission’s recommendations, we plan to dissolve the cabinet into sub-committees in analysing and implementing the recommendations.
“There is a need for collaboration with federal agencies, regional governments, security services including the state vigilante group, and the local communities. We have plans to share the report with national security agencies and work with neighbouring states to address the cross-border nature of criminal activities.”
The governor reiterated his commitment to achieving sustainable peace in the region, assuring citizens that he will “read every sentence” in the report and ensure its recommendations are implemented for a safer future.      

He stressed the importance of community involvement, including religious institutions, in tackling the challenges, describing the necessary approach as a “crusade” requiring collective action.

Earlier, the Chairman of the Commission, Prof. Odinkalu, thanked the governor for entrusting them with the task.
Odinkalu, a former Executive Secretary, National Human Rights Commission, noted that the biggest structural factor in the violence is the political economy of land, not IPOB/ESN.
He argued that while Lagos is gaining land, Anambra is losing land due to ecological pressure, crises in leadership, and impunity.
He said, “The Commission surveyed 66 communities in the state, documenting cases of traditional rulers, security agents, presidents-general and community members who have disappeared and remain missing.”
Odinkalu however, emphasised the need to end the use of the term “unknown gunmen,” especially by the media, develop a 25-year security strategy to reform community governance and establish an agency for the protection of victims and accountability for violence.        
A delegation including the Secretary to the State Government, Prof. Solo Chukwulobelu, members of the Anambra Executive Council, Secretary of the Commission, Amb. Bianca Ojukwu and representatives of the United Nations Development Programme attended the event.

Hyacinth Alia, to account for how he expended N44 billion in special intervention grants received from the Federal Government between August 2023 to 2024.
The opposition party in the state, through its State Publicity Secretary, Bemgba Iortyom, made the call while reacting to the submission of the leader of the All Progressive Congress in the state, Senator Tilley Gyado, that N44 billion in the form of intervention funds were accrued to the state in the past nine months.
Gyado who spoke at the APC stakeholders meeting in Makurdi on Sunday had listed the special intervention funds accrued to the state to include, N5 billion post-subsidy removal, N9 billion Infrastructural funds, and N30 billion sub-national intervention funds.
However, the state government and other states have denied receipt of N30 billion as alleged by the Senate President, Senator Godwin Akpabio. 






The State Commissioner for Finance and Budget Planning, Michael Oglegba, who spoke to our correspondent about a week ago, stated there were some interventions received from the Federal Government but denied the N30 billion interaction fund.  Related News  Scores killed as bandits sack nine Benue communities  Benue Assembly rejects gov’s nominee over Facebook post  Parliamentary workers seek full financial autonomy for state legislature   
The PDP in the state described the statement by the APC leader as ‘shocking’, saying,  there had been no disclosure from the governor of receipt of such funds, except the post-subsidy removal (palliatives) fund which, after much pressure from our end, he had accepted having received in part N2 billion, and thereafter had kept sealed lips over the outstanding N3 billion.
“If there was a N9 billion infrastructure fund and a N30 billion Sub-national intervention fund, the people of Benue State are only getting to know about it from the APC statement, and this by all standards of transparency and accountability is unacceptable.      
“PDP is saddened that this non-disclosure of N44 billion federal intervention grants by Governor Alia reinforces his policy of concealment and disregard for due process and the rule of law which underpin a style of governance that is in character a sole administratorship.”
The opposition party urged the governor to come clean and disclose how he had expended the N44 billion special grants, as to do otherwise would be to thicken further the cloud of suspicions hovering over his administration.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/29080512/Rev.-Fr.-Hyacinth-Alia.png

It specifically stated that 25 out of every 100 individuals in Nigeria continue to depend on unsafe water sources.
The Minister of Water Resources and Sanitation, Prof. Joseph Utsev, who disclosed this at a press briefing in Abuja to mark World Water Day, said, “This means, yes, according to the United Nations, out of every 100 persons, 25 get their water from open streams and ponds.
“A good percentage relieves themselves outdoors or use dirty, dangerous or broken latrines, leading to human waste flowing into nature untreated, with disastrous health and environmental consequences.” 






Utsev, however, stated that the Federal Government was implementing several initiatives to manage the situation, as he outlined key projects aimed at tackling the water crisis head-on.
“The Partnership for Expanded Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene programme, focused on enhancing water access in rural areas and public sanitation is one of such initiatives.
“Additionally, the Sustainable Urban, Rural and Small Towns Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene programme, supported by the World Bank, targets water supply challenges in both urban and rural settings.      
“The National WASH Action Plan is also in place to address the low access to WASH services across Nigeria,” he stated.  Related News  FG demands proof of approval from workers on study leave   FG names 15 terrorism  financiers, BDCs, plans sanctions  FG proposes $1bn for ports rehabilitation   
He said the government was committed to addressing the crisis, and called for continued collaboration with development partners and donors to support these initiatives.
Utsev stated that since his assumption of office, the Federal Government had ensured that 15 Local Governments in five states of the federation attained the Open Defecation-Free status.
“As of today, we have 120 Local Governments across the country which are Open Defecation-Free, with our states having obtained statewide ODF in the country,” the minister stated.
Meanwhile, a report by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation for the World Water Day, revealed that 2.2 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking water.
It also stated that 3.5 billion people were without safely managed sanitation, adding that water scarcity often emerges as a potential catalyst for conflicts worldwide.
UNESCO Director-General, Audrey Azoulay, stated that water scarcity, affecting one in two people globally, could exacerbate geopolitical tensions and threaten fundamental rights, particularly for girls and women.        
The report estimated the cost of achieving universal access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene in 140 low and middle-income countries at approximately $1.7tn from 2016 to 2030.
“The theme of World Water Day 2024, ‘Water for Peace,’ is therefore a call to action to sustainably manage water, to reconnect with our planet and, ultimately, to build peace,’’ Azoulay stated.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/24015230/Water.jpeg

Nigeria’s Brass River and Qua Iboe have both reduced in price to $89.26, from $91.08 about 72 hours ago. 






The PUNCH reported on Monday that prices of crude oil rose within the past one week following attacks on Russian refineries by the Ukrainian fighters.

According to Reuters, though gasoline inventories fell for a seventh week from 3.3 million barrels to 230.8 million gasoline product supplied, a proxy for product demand slipped below 9 million barrels.

This came as Presidency warned currency speculators to desist from unpatriotic act against the national currency, saying racketeers would have their fingers burnt.
The naira gain came a day after the local currency recorded major gains at both the official and parallel foreign exchange markets. It closed at the black market at N1,400/dollar on Wednesday.
The summary of the FX trading auction revealed that naira appreciated by 1.3 percent following increased dollar supply at the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Market, according to data from the FMDQ Securities Exchange Limited. 






The intraday high closed at N1,598 per dollar on Thursday, stronger than N1,620 it closed at on Wednesday. Also, the intraday low strengthened to N1,300/$ on the same day, stronger than N1,350/$1 closed at on the previous day.
The dollar supplied by FX market players increased to $288.47, an increase of $2 or 7.46 percent from $268.29 million recorded on Wednesdat from $195.13 million at NAFEM.
In the recent weeks, the naira has gained N500 against the  dollar from it record low this year at the unofficial market, as the CBN builds confidence in  FX market.      
The Central Bank of Nigeria declared on Wednesday that it has successfully resolved all valid foreign exchange backlogs, as pledged by Governor Olayemi Cardoso, addressing inherited claims amounting to $7bn.
Hakama Sidi Ali, CBN’s acting director of corporate communications, conveyed this information in a statement sent via mail. She stated that the CBN finalised the payment of $1.5 billion to settle obligations to bank customers, thereby clearing the remaining balance of the FX backlog.
Cardoso emphasised the priority of clearing the FX backlog to enhance credibility and confidence in the Nigerian economy.

Additionally, the CBN reported a significant surge in Diaspora remittances, which skyrocketed by 433 percent to $1.3 billion in February, compared to $300 million in January
Meanwhile, the Special Adviser on Information and Strategy, Bayo Onanuga, has cautioned currency traders speculating on foreign exchange to sell their dollar holdings, stating that the naira is expected to increase in value soon.        
He advised speculators to sell off their dollars to prevent potential losses swiftly.
Onanuga said, “With backlog FX settled, Naira is set to appreciate further, faster. Currency speculators should quickly dump their stock of dollars to avoid sorrows and tears.
On Wednesday, the naira closed trading at 1,410/dollar at the parallel market and N1,492 at the official Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Market, according to data compiled from the FMDQ Securities Exchange.

The naira has been gaining lately as speculators begin to dump their dollar stocks, following waning demand by prospective buyers amid CBN clampdowns.
A string of circulars by the Central Bank of Nigeria in recent weeks and months have helped to plug leakages and blocked loopholes previously explored by currency speculators and racketeers.

The data was collated from the breakdown of funds earmarked for international travels in the 2024 budget by 103 MDAs.
President Bola Tinubu had raised concerns about the rising costs of international travels borne by director, permanent sectaries and workers of the federal civil service.
As result, the president in a letter dated March 12, 2024; signed by the Chief of Staff to the President, Femi Gbajabiamila; and addressed to the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, George Akume, banned government officials from embarking on public-funded trips overseas. 






The ban, which is meant to reduce costs in governance, will become effective April 1, 2024.
It read partly, “Considering the current economic challenges and the need for responsible fiscal management, I am writing to communicate Mr President’s directive to place a temporary ban on all public funded international trips for all Federal Government officials at all levels, for an initial period of three months from Ist April 2024.”
It added, “This temporary measure is aimed at cost reduction in governance and intended as a cost-saving measure without compromising government functions.”      
Tinubu, however, added that government officials who needed to go on any public-funded foreign trip must seek and get presidential approval at least two weeks before embarking on such trip, which must be ‘deemed absolutely necessary’.
The latest development came days after Nigerians, civil society organizations and rights groups lambasted the Accountant General of the Federation, commissioners of finance of the 36 states of the federation and other government officials for choosing to hold a workshop in the United Kingdom at a time when the economy was experiencing a major downturn.
However, in the breakdown, the latest policy by the Tinubu administration is expected to affect 43 permanent secretaries. According to findings, there are currently 43 PS under the Federal Civil Service.
According to an analysis of MDAs notable for travelling, the State House (Presidency) will save about N1.74bn in three months while the Vice President’s office will save N307.3m. The Ministry of Petroleum Resources with a total budget of N1.19bn for international travel will save N299.5m in three months.  Related News  Justify money spent on Ramadan feeding, APC  challenges Kano gov  Current economic hardship will soon be over -  Minister  Foreign trips ban will save FG N5bn quarterly, says Tinubu   
Further analysis also stated that the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment will save N176.79m if the directive is implemented. Also, the National Defence College will save N984.6m from its total budget of N3.9bn for overseas travel while the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission will save N434.56m. Similarly, the Nigerian Intelligence Agency will save N860.8m from its total budget of N1.04bn. The Office of the Secretary General of the Federation will save N47.5m if it adheres to the presidential directive while the auditor general will return N114.9m to government coffers due to the policy.
Furthermore, the Finance Ministry will save N173.2m while the Ministry of Budget and Economic Planning will keep N173m if its workers shelve plan to travel internationally. For the Command and Staff College, a total of N631.48m will be saved in three months. The Ministry of Justice will preserve N212.32m if the directive is implemented while the Youth Development Ministry will save N70.8m.
Findings show that the cost could be more if foreign trips budgets of other MDAs that are not notable for travelling overseas are also incurred.        
Tinubu had implemented a number of initiative aimed at cutting the cost of governance.
On January 8, the President approved “cost-cutting” measures that involve slashing, by 60%, official entourage on local and international travels.
The Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Ajuri Ngelale, revealed this while briefing State House correspondents at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.
Ngelale said the directive applied to the Offices of the President, Vice President, First Lady, Wife of the Vice President and all Ministries, Departments and Agencies.
He said, “President Bola Tinubu has approved that anywhere he travels within this country he will no longer accept or allow huge security delegations to be following him from Abuja, which attracts massive bills with respect to estacode and duty allowances from now on.
“He has approved a massive cost-cutting exercise that will cut across the entire Federal Government of Nigeria and the Offices of the President himself, the Vice President and the Office of the First Lady. It will be conducted in the following fashion.
“On international trips, the President has directed that no more than 20 individuals be allowed to travel with him. That number will be cut down to five in the case of the First Lady. Additionally, the number in the entourage on official international trips for the Vice President will be cut to five. The number that will be placed as a limit on the wife of the Vice President is also five.”      
The decision came five weeks after Nigerians criticised the Tinubu administration for participating in the United Nation’s annual climate summit, COP28, in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates with 1,114 delegates.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/30084929/Femi-Gbajabiamila.jpeg

Dada explained that even though people had the right to migrate, they had to do it legally.

It added that it was more troubling that the members had not listened to the manufacturers before rushing to judgment and castigating the manufacturers.
The statement read in part, “Members alleged that the manufacturers were exploitative as they engaged in arbitrary fixing of cement price. Some members even described the manufacturers as unpatriotic. 






“These were narratives on the floor of the house which we consider to be most unfair to investors in the cement sector, especially when the perspectives of the cement manufacturers had not been heard by the members of the house.”
According to the CPPE, cement manufacturers were disparaged, denigrated and portrayed as deliberately inflicting pain on the Nigerians by arbitrarily increasing the price of cement.

The centre, which described the comments as unfair, said such weighty allegations should be premised on painstaking study, empirical facts and evidence.      
It further stated that such commentaries represented negative signalling for an economy seeking to industrialise, attract investors and create jobs.
The CPPE noted that the principles of fairness demand that the cement manufacturers be allowed to tell their own stories before members could come to a fair conclusion and judgement.
It added, “But regrettably, they have been judged publicly, before giving them the opportunity to present their own side of the story.  We believe this is a breach of the norms and standards of fairness and equity.

business,"Smoke out illegal miners, FG tells 2,200 new mining marshals","The Federal Government through the Ministry of Solid Development Minerals has secured the services of 2,220 security personnel under a new security architecture with the mandate to smoke out illegal m...",22nd March 2024,https://punchng.com/smoke-out-illegal-miners-fg-tells-2200-new-mining-marshals/,Damilola Aina,"The Federal Government through the Ministry of Solid Development Minerals has secured the services of 2,220 security personnel under a new security architecture with the mandate to smoke out illegal miners and all those who flout the nation’s mining laws.
It also charged the new operatives to stem theft and all nefarious activities around the nation’s mineral resources to enable the nation to reap maximum benefits from its God-given resources.
The Minister of Solid Mineral Development, Dele Alake, gave this charge when he received the specially trained officers drafted from the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps code-named “Mining Marshal Corps” at the ministry’s headquarters on Thursday in Abuja.
This latest development came two months after President Bola Tinubu established an inter-ministerial committee led by the Solid Minerals minister to deliberate on modalities in achieving its mandate of producing a blueprint for securing the country’s natural resources including solid minerals, forests, and marine economy. 






With a command structure spread across the 36 states and the FCT, the mining marshals will have their command and control domiciled in the Ministry of Solid Minerals Development, with  60 operatives first deployed in each state of the federation and the FCT.
According to him, the official reception of the marshals will ensure security at mining sites, eliminate illegality, and sanitise mining environments to counter illegal mining and smuggling of solid minerals from Nigeria. He described this as a major success in his seven-point agenda.
He added that the mining marshals devised to be an inter-agency security outfit will incorporate special operatives from other security agencies like the Nigeria Police, army, amongst others.      
Speaking during the event, Alake said, “Insecurity has bedevilled the mineral sector of this economy and it has combined with other variables to short-change revenue generation. So amongst others, the issue of combating insecurity in this sector is very crucial if we are going to record any success. Without the security of the operating environment in the mineral sector, you can’t even talk of increasing the revenue yield. We hope and believe that the minerals will become the revenue saver of the Nigerian economy and we are pursuing the goal of making the mineral sector contribute more than 50 per cent to the gross domestic product and that is our long-term objective.

“Today’s event of launching and formally handing over the civil defence structure to engage illegal miners and sanitise our mining environment was also part of what we conceived at the inter-ministerial committee. I am very happy to let the public know that we did say at the onset that we are going to tackle insecurity and the first batch of the security apparatus that we are using in this sector is what we are launching here today. The civil defence structure already existed before and we thought that amongst other logistic support that are necessary for the takeoff of the new security architecture for this sector.
“And then in terms of the numbers, we are starting initially with 60 personnel per command. But that is just for the takeoff phase. I have also mentioned that other security agencies will come on board very soon. So the number is going to keep increasing as the need arises. But because we needed to fast track the execution of this policy that’s why this civil defence structure had to be used to execute the mines marshals.”
In his remarks, NSCDC Commandant-General, Abubakar Audi, stated that the new mining marshals would give verve to the corps’ mandate of protecting national assets and infrastructure in which solid minerals are a major component.
Audi revealed that the marshals would liaise with mines inspectorate in states to garner intelligence and will directly and operationally be under the command of the solid minerals minister for the effective execution of its mandate.
“We have a list of illegal miners across the nation, and we will go after them. Their days are now numbered, “Audi declared.
The Chairman, House Committee on Solid Minerals, Hon. Jonathan Gbefwi, who graced the occasion, expressed satisfaction with the new security outfit, noting that with improved security around mining areas, Nigeria’s economic fortunes is bound for a forward leap.        
“When the minister reeled out his 7-point agenda during his inaugural address, which included the Mines Police, not a few people were sceptical about it. But today, he has matched words with action. On behalf of the people of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, I doff my hat for him and say, “Well done.” You can be rest assured of the continued support and cooperation of the House of Reps and, by extension, the National Assembly, Hon. Gbefwi said.

According to a statement, the cement manufacturing company started the road construction in 2010 as an evacuation corridor that spans from Mfamosing, its operational base through Abiati, Etamkpini, and terminates at Odukpani junction by the Ayade’s Flyover.
During the commissioning, Otu commended Lafarge for living up to its Corporate Social Responsibility.
He expressed optimism that the 20-kilometre evacuation road would reduce traffic from the town for Lafarge trucks and other commuters. 






He said, “Development comes with implications. When you have a road, the good people will use it and the bad people will also try to use it.”
Otu assured that security presence would be deployed to forestall any possible nefarious activities.
He added, “I want to give you every assurance that the security agencies we have here are up and doing, I am not sure you will have issues on this road, particularly now that the security of the area has been highlighted.

“For Cross River government, I want to give you every assurance that we will continue to give you the enablement, strength, proper and enabling environment for you to expand and succeed.”
The governor used the occasion to call on other corporate organisations to emulate Lafarge’s gesture to complement the government’s infrastructural development to help society at large.
“It would have been difficult to have about 200 trucks passing through the town, driving out, amid stress and accident.
“What you have done has taken this whole traffic completely out of town and straight to the road where they are actually looking to take things out of the state. I commend you and wish that other Corporate bodies would emulate Lafarge,” he concluded.
Speaking earlier, the Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Lafarge, Alade Akinyemi, informed the Governor that the project was started in 2010, but was delayed due to challenges associated with geotechnical studies and the design.
He said, “The road will improve safety, drive economic growth, and enhance productivity due to reduction of man hour as a result of no traffic and congestion.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/19022246/otu-e1689729766579.jpg

He spoke durin...",22nd March 2024,https://punchng.com/operators-worry-over-inability-to-hedge-against-forex-volatility/,Edidiong Ikpoto,"The depreciation of the local currency makes it difficult for firms to hedge, according to the Group Chief Operating Officer of Waltersmith Group, Alex Osho, and other business leaders.
He spoke during a panel session at the Lagos Business School Chief Financial Officer Conference, which was held in Lagos on Wednesday.
According to Osho, even though firms usually have several tools to hedge against currency depreciation, these tools are often incongruent with the context of Nigeria’s economy.
Osho said, “Even though the tools are there, there is no liquidity. For all the companies that declared huge (forex) losses, it is not as if the CFOs didn’t know what to do or have a way around it. It is just that they were helpless to a large extent. 






“What tends to happen is that companies that have a natural hedge tend to fare better. Natural hedge means that your revenue sources match your funding sources. That is why many companies are looking for revenue sources by having an export route. Without that, it is difficult.”
Similarly, when asked what his company was doing to cushion the impact of the recent forex illiquidity, the Chief Executive Officer of IHS Nigeria, Mohamad Darwish, said, “We don’t know how to cope.”
On his part, the Chief Executive Officer of Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc, Boye Olusanya, noted that companies must explore business alternative business models such as import substitution to insulate themselves from forex-related shocks.      
He said, “The biggest thing is sitting and looking at ways to manage your business by looking for divergent inflow that are non-FX driven.”
Representing the CEO of Stanbic IBTC Bank, Wole Adeniyi, the bank’s Executive Director,
Personal and Private Banking Nigeria, Olu Delano, advised firms to find ways to adapt to the currency devaluation and “keep moving forward”.
In his opening remarks, the Dean of the Lagos Business School, Prof Chris Ogbechie, stated that in today’s rapidly evolving landscape, the role of a CFO had never been more pivotal, especially because businesses were grappling with inconsistent government policy and a vast array of challenges in the macroeconomic environment.
According to Ogbechie, CFOs are stewards of financial health, who offer strategic insights and financial acumen that are indispensable in navigating today’s complex and dynamic business environment.
 “In today’s rapidly evolving business landscape, the role of the Chief Finance Officer has never been more pivotal. CFOs are stewards of financial health and custodians of strategic decision-making.
 “Thus, they are tasked with navigating complexities, driving innovation, and ensuring sustainable growth for their organisations.        
“By assuming the role of strategic architects, CFOs contribute to shaping the future direction of the organisation, driving growth, managing risks, and maximising shareholder value,” he noted.

The Group CEO of Dangote Industries Ltd, Kunle Alake, who was represented by DIL’s Technical Lead, Finance Office of the Vice President, Isah Aruwa, emphasised that CFOs have to be at the forefront of driving sustainable growth and managing risks such as currency risks, security risks, among others.
He also stressed that CFOs have to be the middleman between the business and the stakeholders to understand what they want.
He also advised CFOs to pay attention to foreign exchange management, as it could have devastating consequences for any business.
The Vice President of Financial Controls & Budget at Africa Finance Corporation, Yeside Onafuye, who spoke on Maximising Stakeholder Value through Strategic Synergy of the CEO
and CFO, noted that when the CEO-CFO relationship is symbiotic, the organisation would have strong leaders capable of navigating through tough times.
According to her, the success recorded by some of the world’s most successful companies, such as Amazon and Apple, has been a function of seamless CFO-CEO relationships.      
On his part, the CEO of the Financial Reporting Council of Nigeria, Rabiu Olowo, represented by the council’s Coordinating Director, Accounting Standards and Sustainability Reporting Unit, Iheanyi Anyahara, said that to unlock FDI and attract FPI in Nigeria, companies must incorporate sustainability reporting in their annual reporting.
Olowo further stated that effective communication is a key attribute of the modern CFO, and that “he must embrace this attribute when relating with all stakeholders”.
He added, “We must move away from the era of financial jargon to financial reporting that meets different users of financial information at their level.”
While presenting a keynote address titled ‘Beyond Numbers: The Strategic Role of CFOs in Sustainable Business Leadership,’ the Group CFO of Ecobank Transnational Incorporated, Ayo Adepoju, declared that the CFO must see himself as the chief performance officer.
He added that it was important for the credibility of the CFO to remain intact because people usually look at the message through the prism of the messenger.
Adepoju further harped on the fact that the CFO must observe the changes in the business world and understand how those changes would shape the future.

“However, everything changed when I discovered Terra Gold Cube. I was finally able to use one cube for all types of meals. I was blown away by the complement in taste it added to my various dishes.

Meanwhile, PZ Cussons was flat at N40, though the volume of traded shares increased to 29,407 on Thursday from 1,400 on Wednesday.
This comes after the firm announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission had declined to grant a No-Objection for it to buy out minority shareholders at N23.
Investment Research Analyst, Callista Chileke, at ARM Securities in her comments highlighted how that development would impact minority investors.
She said, “The rejection of PZ Cussons delisting from the NGX by the SEC poses significant effects on its existing shareholders. They decided to delist i.e., PZ Cussons buying out minority shareholders to allow the company to return to longer-term growth.
“PZ recorded significant FX losses and due to the rapid depreciation of the naira, and was pushed into a negative asset position where its liabilities, which are majorly denominated in foreign currency were more than their assets.”
According to Chileke, the buy-out was a means to raise funds for the company but with this denial, the company would have to resort to other measures such as equity issuance, debt for equity conversion, rights issues or asset sales, which could negatively impact its current shareholders.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/31225705/nn.png

He stated this at a workshop organised by the Standards Organisation of Nigeria with the theme ‘Promoting Palm Oil Value Chain via Standardisation’ in Osogbo, Osun State recently.
Owolarafe noted that the country still imports about 1 million metric tonne of the product to complement the local production.
He said, “Between 1920 and 1960, Nigeria was the leading producer and exporter of palm oil. Sadly, Indonesia and Malaysia now lead in the production of palm oil in the whole world. 






“Though there has been an increase in palm oil production in the last few years, Nigeria at present imports palm oil to the tune of about one million metric tonnes to supplement the local production to meet the high demand.

“Indonesia and Malaysia produce tens of million tonnes, while Nigeria is still struggling to reach two million tonnes. Currently, Nigeria, which occupied the premier position, has dropped to the fifth position.”
According to Owolarafe, factors such as declining productivity of oil palm plantations due to old age, lack of appropriate technologies for palm fruit processing, and unfavourable government policies regarding agriculture in general, among others, contributed to the country’s low production of palm oil.      
He challenged the producers to improve the quality and quantity of palm oil production in the country to meet the international standards for export.
Earlier, SON’s Director-General, Dr Ifeanyi Okeke, who was represented by the agency’s Director, Southwest, Ethan Talatu, declared that the workshop was organised to create awareness for all stakeholders, particularly the palm oil producers, distributors, marketers, retailers and users on the need to produce product that would meet up with the standard set by the government.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/09185545/Palm_oil_production_in_Jukwa_Village_Ghana-03-e1489082167561.jpg

The shift, he said, had benefited Nigerian used cars, particularly Japanese brands like Toyota and Honda, which had experienced a surge in demand.
He cited a report indicating that the Nigerian used-car market was now valued at over $1.4bn and expected to grow significantly by the end of 2024.
He said the trend underscored the impact of the forex crisis on consumer preferences within the Nigerian automotive market, with a noticeable shift away from foreign used cars towards more affordable domestic options. 






Ojurongbe stated, “We have been witnessing a steady rise in rates over the years, with the FX crisis impacting all car categories, especially foreign used cars due to their ties to exchange rates.
“This unpredictability has led dealers to pass on costs to clients, causing a surge in demand and prices for Nigerian used cars,” he stated.
He said that recent developments in import tariffs, taxation, and regulatory policies were reshaping the landscape of Nigeria’s automotive market.

According to Ojurongbe, the Nigerian Customs Service started using black market rates for clearing, until the recent intervention by the Central Bank of Nigeria.
He, however, expressed optimism that the proposed automation of the clearing process at ports in 2023 was expected to have a direct impact on vehicle prices, influencing consumer preferences and purchasing behaviour.
Furthermore, Ojurongbe said that the recent removal of subsidies, particularly on gasoline, was causing a ripple effect in the market.
He said with the increased petrol costs, consumers are reevaluating their vehicle choices, favouring options that offer better fuel efficiency.
According to Ojurongbe, the shift in demand is notably boosting interest in hybrid cars, which are renowned for their ability to maximise fuel economy.
The value of Nigeria’s used vehicle imports increased from N325.05bn in 2022 to N1.063tn in 2023, representing a 226.46 per cent increase over one year, according to the 2023 National Bureau of Statistics foreign trade report.

The shippers spoke on Wednesday in Lagos at the maiden press conference of the National Shippers Association of Nigeria.
Shippers are exporters, importers, manufacturers and owners of cargoes being exported or imported into the country.
Speaking during the event, the President-General of NSAN, Innocent Akuvue, lamented the protracted exchange rate crisis and the attendant effect had affected members of the association and manufacturers. 






He also blamed the inconsistent policies on the part of the government, noting that some policies had been implemented by the government without due consultation of the stakeholders.
“There is also a complex nature and inconsistencies in the process of clearing plus the rising cost of doing business at the ports. Our roads and other infrastructure including logistics of goods from the ports have been a challenge,” Akuvue said.

“Some of the goods we ordered for and paid for since the era of COVID-19, which were disrupted then, are still coming back now and we are faced with the challenges of clearing them with the new rate.”

BASL emphasised that aside from the significant revenue generation opportunities inherent in regional flight operations at the MMA2 in Lagos, the development  would also help domestic airlines already operating at the terminal to save huge cost when they operate regional flights from the facility.
This call to action was made on Thursday during a courtesy visit by the BASL team to the PUNCH newspapers headquarters in Ogun State.
The team, which was led by the of Head of Aeronautics and Cargo Services, Mr Remi Jibodu, had in attendance the Head of Aviation Security, Monica Aguta; Head of Corporate Communications, Ajoke Yinka-Olawuyi; and Media Executive, Funmi Ayanwusi. 






Jibodu while responding to questions during the visit said launching regional flights at MMA2 would play a pivotal role in fostering the growth and advancement of Nigeria’s aviation sector.
With a wealth of experience and established facilities, BASL chief expressed confidence in the MMA2’s capacity to effectively handle regional flights at the facility.
“After 17 years of operation, we can still confirm that our facilities are under-utilised. Hence, our advocacy for regional flights. With existing infrastructure in place and two domestic airlines already operating regional flights, we’re well-equipped to accommodate and support such operations,” the team lead said.      
“Additionally, exploring public-private partnerships presents an opportunity to attract investment and foster growth in Nigeria’s aviation sector. We must prioritise existing stakeholders while welcoming new investors to ensure sustainable development,” he added.
In 2016, BASL’s MMA2 was reportedly certified for regional flight operations by the Ministerial Committee on Airport Security and received regulatory approval to commence regional services.
The industry regulator, the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority, was among the agencies that had inspected the terminal, but it was yet to grant the final approval to kick-start regional flights.
Jibodu reiterated that the company possesses the necessary infrastructure to accommodate regional flights.
Furthermore, he underscored the importance of exploring public-private partnerships as a means to attracting investment and stimulating growth within Nigeria’s aviation sector.
In recent times, incidents of passenger misconduct, including physical and verbal abuse of airport and airline officials during flight delays, have been on the rise at the Lagos airport.
The MMA2 operator advised against passengers’ frequent misconduct while expressing commitment to improving customers’ experience.        
With a focus on communication strategies and passenger education, BASL said it aimed to foster a culture of respect and enhance the overall airport experience.
As part of the measures to give optimum passenger satisfaction, BASL launched premium services, which among other things, offer separate check-in and check-out.
The team lead further noted, “We’ve observed instances where passengers, frustrated by flight delays, resort to mistreating airport and airline staff, which is unacceptable.
“To address this issue, we’ve implemented measures such as providing meals after a two-hour delay. However, some passengers may refuse meals and even cancel flights altogether,” he revealed.
BASL also unveiled a flight disruption guideline in collaboration with the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority to mitigate delays and ensure passenger satisfaction.
“These guidelines aim to prevent such incidents and ensure a positive passenger experience. We’ve received positive feedback from the NCAA and airlines, emphasising the importance of prioritising passenger satisfaction and operational efficiency,” Jibowu stated.
The NCAA flight data for 2022 revealed 877 flight cancellations in Nigeria, with 795 by domestic airlines and 82 by international carriers.  This indicates that domestic flights had over 90 er cent of the canceled flights.      
According to the NCAA, in the first quarter of 2023, out of 3,073 international flights in the country, 1,193 were delayed.
According to Aguta, there will be a zero-tolerance policy towards abusive behaviour against airport and airline officials.
She recalled recent incidents, including a troubling encounter with a Dana Air official who was abused by a passenger.
Aguta expressed that BASL was committed to fostering a culture of respect and professionalism among passengers, ensuring that everyone understands the importance of respectful conduct at the airport.
Speaking during the meeting, Yinka-Olawuyi said it was sacrosanct for the media to help educate the passengers on how to conduct themselves appropriately at the airport.
She reeled our several steps MMA2 has taken to create optimum passenger experience and educate the passengers.
The BASL delegation was warmly received by the PUNCH team, led by the General Manager, Digital Operations and Publications, Mr Ademola Oni; Editorial Board Chairman, Mr. Obafemi Obadare, Associate/Group Business Editor, Mr. Oyetunji Abioye.  
In his remarks, Oni underscored the imperative of adherence to aviation laws and regulations, following the observation of behavioural challenges at airports.
According to Oni, the conduct witnessed at airport mirrors broader societal attitudes and emphasised the necessity of enforcing existing laws to maintain order and ensure a positive passenger experience.
The GM noted that while the media plays a crucial role in educating passengers, it cannot enforce aviation laws.
He stressed the significance of regulatory compliance and urged all stakeholders to prioritise adherence to established protocols for the safety and well-being of all travelers.
“What we have seen at the airport is a reflection of the country that we live in. We have laws guiding every operation at the airport.
“The media can only educate the passengers but cannot implement those laws. Nigerians are becoming more sensitive to the socioeconomic situation of the country,” he added.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/31023637/Bi-Courtney-Aviation-Services-Limited-BASL-3.jpeg

In a statement on Wednesday, the Registrar/Chief Executive Officer, of NICA, Prof. Chris Onalo, stated that those attributes were necessary for a sound credit system.
The Institute of Credit Administration is Nigeria’s only nationally recognised professional credit management body, solely dedicated to the provision of micro and macro credit management education, award of specialist qualifications, development of skills and capacity building of people involved in the everyday management of trade, financial, consumer and business credits in Nigeria and globally.
Onalo said the intention was to keep credit professionals on their toes by being professional, ethical, and transparent. 






“When we talk about being ethical, transparent, and carrying out the duty of care to make sure that credit appraisal processes are transparent, we are looking to keep credit professionals on their toes by being very professional, ethical, and transparent
“This is against the backdrop of credit possibly going bad as a result of unethical conducts, some of which might not be economically motivated, but could be factors that can be prevented,” he said.
According to Onalo, when a credit professional is appraising a customer for either a credit line, credit review, or credit limit upgrade, the customer must be thoroughly assessed based on the knowledge of the customer and the industry that the credit professional.

He added that credit assessment, appraisal or evaluation must consider the business growth, or business downtown experience that the credit professional may have observed with the customer over time.
“This is important so that what the credit professional sees at the end of the day, or at any time, is how the credit customers’ business can continuously be positioned and repositioned for growth, expansion and sustainable contribution to the economy,” Onalo asserted.
The NICA boss reiterated that if a credit professional failed to commit to the ethical and transparent credit appraisal process, “chances are that the credit transaction in question may go bad, and such a credit professional might be in a dilemma of turning that account around, which means bad debt would occur. This means that the end testifies to the beginning”.
He stated that NICA was holding credit professionals to that commitment, “to this end, when credit appraisal is being carried out, appropriate credit and business information must be gathered to build mitigation bridges against defaults”.
“To enable credit managers and their teams to do their job of appraising, controlling, managing, monitoring and recovering, it is important to state that the organisations and individuals who use credit to expand, grow, sustain or start up a business, or buy on credit today and pay tomorrow, must endeavour to live up to their obligations,” he declared.
He warned against abuse of credit and the use of credit as a means to defraud the economy.
Onalo remarked, “The bigger the information you have on the credit customer, the more likelihood you have of the success of that account.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/01041441/NICA.png

This came as the Central Bank of Nigeria announced the final settlements of all valid foreign exchange backlogs, fulfilling a key pledge of the apex bank governor, Mr. Olayemi Cardoso, to process an inherited backlog of $7bn in claims.
The Acting CBN Director, Corporate Communications, Mrs. Hakama Sidi Ali, who disclosed this in Abuja on Wednesday, recalled the central bank had recently cleared $1.5bn from the backlogs.
On Wednesday, the naira closed trading at 1,410/dollar at the parallel market and N1,492 at the official Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Market, according to data compiled from the FMDQ Securities Exchange. 






The gain recorded by the naira at the official market represents an appreciation of N68 or 4.5 per cent, from the N1,560/$1 recorded on Tuesday at NAFEM, and a gain of 13.5 per cent or N190 at the parallel market.
According to findings by The PUNCH, the exchange rate has been gaining lately as speculators begin to dump their dollar stocks, following waning demand by prospective buyers amid CBN clampdowns.
A string of circulars by the Central Bank of Nigeria in recent weeks and months have helped to plug leakages and blocked loopholes previously explored by currency speculators and racketeers.      
Also, the recent clampdowns on the activities of illegal BDC operators in Lagos, Abuja and Kano by the operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission have helped to reduce the volatility of the naira.
 A Bureau De Change Operator at Wuse 2, Abuja, Ibrahim Yahu, said on Wednesday that the greenback was bought at the rate of N1400/$1 and sold at N1500/$, allowing operators to make a spread of N100/$1.
He said, “The highest I can buy from you is N1400/$ but we are selling at N1500/$.
He noted that some persons bought at the rate N1,300/$ during the daily trading activity.
Another currency trader, Malam Musa Yahyah, at the Central Business District in the FCT, expressed mixed feelings about the new rate, stating that some traders were forced to sell at loss due to a waning demand for the greenback.
In Lagos, a currency trader at Allen Avenue, Ikeja, Mustafa Ibrahim, said the waning demand for the dollar, partly driven by the commencement of dollar sale to BDC operators at the rate of 1,300/dollar, had further weakened demand for the greenback.
He said most traders bought and sold the dollar at N1350 and N1450 on Wednesday. According to Ibrahim, the local currency may reach a new high of 1,200/dollar in weeks if the trend continues.        
Also, Mallam Abubakar Salisu, who sells FX at the Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos, said the naira-dollar exchange rate at the parallel market had been fluctuating in recent times due to the activities of the CBN and the EFCC.
“As of today, many of us bought and sold at 1,400/dollar and N1,450/dollar. The rate is still volatile but many of us are anxious to sell because we know the dollar will soon crash. The only challenge is that many us bought the FX when the rate was around N1,600, so we are concerned about the loss. We are seeking to minimise the loss,” he said.
Meanwhile, the intraday high closed at N1,620 per dollar for the spot on Tuesday while the intraday low closed at N1,350/$1 on the same day.
The daily foreign exchange market turnover increased to $268.29m from $195.13 million recorded on Tuesday.
On Tuesday, The PUNCH exclusively reported that forex turnover at the official foreign exchange market increased to $11.43bn within two months of trading, following fresh reforms by the CBN.
An analysis of reports and data of daily forex transactions recorded on the website of FMDQ Securities, a platform that publishes official foreign exchange trading in the country, indicated that the figure increased by 185.75 per cent or $7.43bn between January and March 15th, 2024.
The improved liquidity at NAFEM followed a directive by the CBN on February 1, 2024, asking banks to sell their excess dollar stock to improve liquidity in the FX market within 24 hours.      
The naira has continued to appreciate against the dollar following some foreign exchange measures put in place by the Central Bank of Nigeria.
Some of the FX reforms include efforts made at achieving a willing buyer-willing seller market; removal of all limits on margins for the International Money Transfer Operator remittances; introduction of a two-way quote system and the broad reforms in the Bureau De Change segment of the market to restore stability, enhance transparency, boost of supply, and promote of price discovery in the Nigeria Autonomous Foreign Exchange Market.
The pressure on the naira/dollar exchange rate is beginning to ease as Nigeria’s external reserves have sustained growth in one month.
Data from the CBN showed that the foreign currency reserves increased by 3.62 per cent to $34.37bn as of March 12, 2024 from $33.17bn recorded at the beginning of February 2024.
The CBN recently announced a remarkable upswing in Diaspora remittances, soaring by 433 per cent to reach $1.3b in February, compared to $300m in January.
CBN announces 
Meanwhile, acting CBN Director, Sidi Ali, said the clearing of the FX backlogs followed a significant increase in external reserves.  
She said the month-on-month increase in the reserves was driven by a marked advance in remittance payments by Nigerians overseas, as well as higher purchases of local assets, including government debt securities by foreign investors.  Related News  BREAKING: CBN clears $7bn forex backlogs  Binance executives to remain in detention for two weeks  CBN holds 294th MPC meeting Monday   
Ali emphasised that meticulous efforts were undertaken to settle these outstanding transactions.
The apex bank noted that independent auditors from Deloitte Consulting meticulously assessed each transaction in the $7bn FX backlog, ensuring that only legitimate claims were honored.
It noted that all invalid transactions were promptly flagged for further scrutiny by relevant authorities.
Cardoso had recent underscored the importance of clearing the FX backlog to restore credibility and confidence in the Nigerian economy.
According to the CBN statement, the clearance of the foreign exchange transactions backlog aligns with the comprehensive strategy outlined during last month’s Monetary Policy Committee meeting.
The primary objectives include stabilising the exchange rate and mitigating imported inflation. By doing so, the CBN aims to bolster confidence in the banking system and stimulate economic growth.      
Cardoso was said to have further communicated the expectations during a conference call with foreign portfolio investors, emphasising sustained increases in Nigeria’s foreign currency reserves and improved liquidity in the foreign exchange market.
“It was important that we go through an independent and credible process that would determine the authenticity of those obligations, and, at this point, I can tell you that we have now cleared all genuine, verifiable transactions. This encumbrance to market confidence in the country’s ability to meet its obligations is now totally behind us,” he added.
The CBN action signifies a pivotal moment in the financial landscape, paving the way for a more resilient and stable economy.
As the nation moves forward, the successful clearance of the FX backlog serves as a beacon of confidence for investors and businesses alike.
The statement partly read, “the Central Bank of Nigeria has announced that all valid foreign exchange backlogs have now been settled, fulfilling a key pledge of the CBN Governor, Mr. Olayemi Cardoso, to process an inherited backlog of $7bn in claims.
“Clearance of the foreign exchange transactions backlog is part of the overall strategy detailed in last month’s Monetary Policy Committee meeting to stabilise the exchange rate and thereby curb imported inflation, spurring confidence in the banking system and the economy. Cardoso used the MPC meeting and a subsequent conference call with foreign portfolio investors to set expectations for sustained increases in Nigeria’s foreign currency reserves and improved liquidity in the foreign exchange market.”
Banks        
Meanwhile, some banks have asked their customers to submit tax clearance for the last three years when applying for Form A.
Form A, which is an application form designed by the Central Bank of Nigeria to pay for service transactions such as school fees, medical fees, and more, allows customers to purchase funds at the CBN or interbank rate to make payments for these services.
An email notification from Standard Chartered to its customers revealed that effective next month, they would be required to submit their TCC for the last three years when seeking forex via banks.
The notice titled ‘Further Update On Tax Clearance Certificate’ reads, “Following our previous communication on submission and verification of Tax Clearance Certificate for all FORM A applications, we wish to remind you of the requirement to provide your updated tax clearance certificate.
“Effective 1st of April, 2024, you are required to upload your 3 years TCC for 2021, 2022 and 2023 assessment year for all new and existing FORM A applications on the CBN trade monitoring system (TRMS). All submitted TCC will be verified by the state tax issuing authority before the application is approved.”
Fidelity Bank and Stanbic IBTC had also released similar circulars to their customers, urging them to submit their TCC to get approval for foreign exchange requests, such as Form A applications.
 A Tax Clearance Certificate serves as evidence of compliance with tax obligations, ensuring adherence to the stipulations outlined in Section 85 (2) of the Personal Income Tax Act, Cap P8, LFN 2004 (as amended).      
Recalled that a global investment bank, Goldman Sachs, had recently predicted that the Naira would appreciate to N1200 per US dollar in twelve months.
Goldman Sachs analysts, Andrew Matheny and Bojosi Morule disclosed this in their recent analysis of Nigeria’s current economic realities.
The US-based financial institution highlighted the recent upward interest rate adjustment by monetary authorities in Nigeria and a recent N1.6tn bill auction by the central bank as signals that the country is turning the tables on a previous unorthodox policy regime that hindered the naira from trading freely.
“These developments have prompted us to shift to a constructive outlook for the Naira, which our FX strategists expect to appreciate to NGN 1200 vs. the USD in 12 months,” Goldman Sachs said.
Goldman Sachs backed the recent monetary policy by the Nigerian government to rescue the Naira, which was described as ‘cheap’ or undervalued.
The analysts believed that the country’s foreign exchange crisis would be resolved if the government saw to monetary policies.
The Central Bank of Nigeria has unveiled several monetary policies.      
The latest was the new draft guidelines for Bureau de Change operators in the last two months.

As it happened with fuel subsidy, the government and major players in the power sector have all agreed on the need to allow customers to pay for the electricity they consume. To them, electricity is no more a service, but a commodity that must be fully paid for by whoever is ready to buy it. While those in the government have been clamouring for an end to the electricity subsidy regime because it was no longer sustainable, investors in the supply chain want a fully deregulated power sector, saying lack of liquidity is ‘killing’ the industry.
Tinubu delaying process
It was gathered that stakeholders in the power sector have been on President Bola Tinubu’s neck to remove the subsidy on electricity. However, there were reports that the President had decided not to heed the request to end the electricity subsidy regime because of the negative effect it would have on Nigerians. 






The President is very aware of the fact that the Nigerian economy ran into a problem after he removed fuel subsidy upon his assumption of office. This, coupled with his policy to float the naira, has made feeding difficult for many Nigerians as prices of commodities continued to skyrocket.
As a result, the repeated calls by stakeholders in the electricity value chain that subsidy be removed are being rebuffed by the President who fears adding more to the sufferings of the masses. Our correspondent learnt that the stakeholders had succeeded in convincing the Minister of Power, Adebayo Adelabu, that the only way to have an effective power sector was to allow liquidity through cost-reflective tariffs, which could only be achieved if the government removed the subsidy and allowed customers to pay for their consumption.
Adelabu had on many occasions emphasised that the government could no longer sustain the payment of subsidy on electricity. In November 2023, Adelabu said that the President stopped the implementation of a hike in electricity tariff and insisted that subsidy be paid on power consumed nationwide.      
Speaking on the call for a cost-reflective tariff, which would lead to a hike in the amount payable for power, Adelabu said, “The power sector is an industry that is very sensitive to any leader. You cannot jump overnight and implement the cost-reflective tariff. I can tell you that till today the government still subsidises power. Tariffs should have been raised months back, but Mr President said until we are able to achieve regular and incremental power supply, we can’t touch the tariff.”
In January, the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission released the 2024 electricity tariffs, which showed that the Federal Government was to shoulder about N1.6tn subsidy for the year, to avert a hike in tariff.
Instead of customers paying N122/KWh in some areas, the NERC allowed the distribution company to charge N56/kWh, leaving the remaining for the government to bear as subsidy. However, Adelabu recently said it was now “very difficult to sustain subsidy on electricity” because the country’s power debt had continued to soar.
The minister stated that only N450bn was appropriated for electricity subsidy in the 2024 budget, but findings by the NERC showed that subsidy would gulp about N2.9tn this year. He revealed that the country was currently indebted to the tune of N1.3tn to electricity generating companies, while the debt to gas companies was $1.3bn.
 The minister had been complaining that the Federal Government had not been able to fulfill its promises to Discos in paying electricity subsidy when due.
“We also want to appeal to the Federal Government that once there is a subsidy promise, it has to be fully funded. If our government is not ready to fund subsidies, it is actually better for us to migrate to a fully cost-reflective tariff; because liquidity is a major issue in the sector, which has led to a huge debt being owed power generating companies. And once they are owed, they are also unable to pay the gas suppliers.
“When the gas suppliers are not paid, they will be unwilling to supply regular gas to them. So, why are these debts piling up? Part of the debts is owed by the Discos. The Federal Government also owes a huge portion of these debts, which relates to the unfunded portion of the subsidy,” Adelabu told newsmen during his last visit to Olorunshogo and Omotosho power plants in Ogun and Ondo States, respectively.        
Despite the pressure from Adelabu, sources said the President had insisted that he would not remove the subsidy on electricity yet.
Discos speak
In an exclusive interview with our correspondent, the Executive Director of Research and Advocacy of the Association of Nigerian Electricity Distributors, Sunday Oduntan, said Tinubu had been the one delaying power subsidy removal.
“As a customer in Nigeria, whether you are metred or not, whatever you are paying is below the cost of production. It is an average of N55/kWh when it should be N112/KWh. That’s why we have shortfalls that is why we are talking about subsidy.
“Until we all agree on the cost of production of electricity and the selling price, we will be talking about the same thing. We should look at it from all angles. Though DisCos also need to be efficient, but if the price is not right, the product will not be available,” he said.
 According to Oduntan, the government has been defaulting in paying electricity subsidies.
“They (FG) paid in the past; they promised to pay some this January. The price was to go up in January; the Federal Government said they would cushion the effect. By law, they have to review the tariff every six months. They reviewed it in December; the new tariff was to take effect in January. The President said, ‘No, don’t inflict more hardship on the people. We can’t remove subsidy on petrol and power at the same time’.      
“That is what the President did. The man is the only person who has not allowed you and me to pay the true cost of electricity since January. The cost should have been between N112 and N150/kWh, but we are still paying N55, and some are paying N62. You know the cost of doing business in Lagos is different from Damaturu, Port Harcourt, Ilorin or Abuja. That is why we have 11 DisCos,” he added.
Subsidise the poor only  Related News  Enugu will generate, distribute electricity by 2026 - Gov  Tinubu may announce new minimum wage on Workers’ Day  Tinubu felicitates UBA chair, Elumelu, at 61   
Oduntan advised the government to subsidise the poor and low-income earners, saying, however, that a database would be required to know who is poor or not.
“How will the government be subsidising power for rich men and people using Rolls Royce? It is not proper. But we don’t have a database to determine who is rich or poor in this country. If there should be subsidy on power, it should be for the low-income earners, the poor; not the rich,” Oduntan maintained.
Senate rejects tariff hike
In February, the Senate kicked against plans by the Ministry of Power to remove electricity subsidy given the current hardships in the country, calling on the government to step down the idea of an increase in electricity tariff.
The upper chamber also directed the committee on power to investigate the N2tn required for electricity subsidy payment to avoid the repeat of the fuel subsidy scenario, other debts owed in the sector, and the state of metering in the country.  
It also resolved to conduct a proper investigation into the reasons behind the call for the removal of electricity subsidy. The Senate President, Godswill Akpabio, announced the resolution after a majority of the senators supported it through voice votes.
The PUNCH reports that the resolution of the Senate followed its consideration and approval of a motion moved by Senator Aminu Abbas of Adamawa Central during plenary on the need to retain subsidy on electricity in the country for the foreseeable future.
Abbas in his lead debate said, “Senate notes with greatest dismay the plan to increase electricity tariff by the relevant statutory authority in gross disregard of increased economic challenges with attendant widespread poverty and high cost of living.
“The Senate may note that the Hon. Minister of Power was reported saying ‘the nation must begin to move towards a cost-effective tariff model, as the country is currently indebted to the tune of N1.3tn naira to generating companies, and $1.3bn owed gas companies.
“According to him, over N2tn needed for subsidy, only N450bn was budgeted this year. The same electricity businesses are collecting money from customers for services not rendered. When they have not added anything to the equipment, they inherited it from PHCN. Communities buy transformers to replace damaged ones in addition to overburden bills and arbitrary estimates for unmetered customers.
“Regret that in addition to the high cost of living being experienced in the country, the unmetered customers who are owners of small and medium enterprises are adversely impacted by exorbitant electricity charges and by implication have their businesses affected.”
Contributing to the debate, Senator Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto South said it was abnormal for the government to “consider hiking electricity tariff in the face of hardship,” stressing that “such action should not even be contemplated in the first place”.      
Similarly, Senator Orji Kalu of Abia North noted that even advanced economies subsidise electricity, saying, “Why should people be paying for what they did not use? Our focus should be on transmission and distribution.”
Subsidy removal in phases 
Following the outcry that greeted the planned subsidy removal, Adelabu proposed a gradual removal of the subsidy, saying it could be done in phases within the next three years.
He also concurred that it would not be fair to remove the subsidy at once in the face of current economic hardship.
“Resulting from the high inflation of almost 30 per cent, resulting from the devaluation of the naira, resulting from the subsidy, there is hardship. And everybody feels it. So, it is not the time that anybody will call for a total removal of electricity subsidy. No.
“It will sound highly insensitive to the feelings of our people. So, what we intend to have in the policy is a roadmap. Probably, two to three years roadmap that will migrate us into a cost-reflective tariff, which means that government subsidy will remain to the end, and we will keep reducing it from time to time.”
 The minister emphasised that currently, the government subsidy was about 66 per cent of the tariffs being paid by Nigerians for power consumption.        
He said a draft policy to be released soon would see attempts at signing up to a minimum payment assurance for capacity in generating companies to ensure sustainability and stabilisation of generation output.
The minister’s statement is an attestation that the government is not going back on its planned removal of electricity subsidy, whether now or in the next three years. As a result, individual consumers should not be caught unawares like in the case of fuel subsidy.
Many feel it would only be fair to remove electricity subsidy after all the over 13 million consumers must have been metered so that Nigerians will not be paying heavily for darkness.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/20222354/ADELABU.jpg
business,Private firm withheld FG's N32bn metre fund for 20 years -Adelabu,"The Minister of Power, Adebayo Adelabu, has explained how a private company reportedly held on to N32bn paid into its account in 2003 for the supply of three million prepaid metres. According to a sta...",21st March 2024,https://punchng.com/private-firm-withheld-fgs-n32bn-metre-fund-for-20-years-adelabu/,Dare Olawin,"The Minister of Power, Adebayo Adelabu, has explained how a private company reportedly held on to N32bn paid into its account in 2003 for the supply of three million prepaid metres.
According to a statement by the minister’s Special Adviser, Strategic Communications and Media Relations, Bolaji Tunji, on Wednesday, the Federal Government had entered a tripartite agreement with Messrs Ziklagsis Network Limited and Unistar International in 2003 for the supply of three million meters to distribution companies in the country, within three years.
The statement indicated that to kick start the project, a revolving metering loan of N32bn was released to Messrs Ziklagsis.
“The agreement was not implemented while the fund remained in the bank account of Ziklagsis at the then Prudent Bank from where it moved to Skye Bank, Polaris and lately, Providus Bank,” the statement read. 






With the privatisation of distribution, Adelabu said the government proposed the metering of Ministries, Departments and Agencies in order to accurately determine the consumption of these MDAs and also reduce accumulated debts, saying “This was what led to the initiative to metre military formations nationwide.”
While debunking reports that due process was not followed in the mass metering project of military formations, which began last week, Adelabu recalled that the Nigerian Army, worried by its huge electricity debt, wrote a letter to the presidency requesting intervention to pay off the outstanding debt and the metering of their formations.  Related News   
The Federal Government, he said, directed the ministry to look into the Army’s request and utilise the N32bn with Ziklagsis.      
The statement added, “It was then that Ziklagsis was introduced to the Nigerian Army by the Ministry of Power. It was around this period that the Nigerian Army also introduced De Haryor Global Services to Ziklagsis to enable them to work together.
“In November 2022, discussion began on the project among the parties and an agreement was signed between the Nigerian Army as a client, Messrs Ziklagsis as project supervisor and De Haryor Global Services as a service provider to commence the metering projects in Army barracks at a cost of N12.7billion, under the MDAs metering project. This predates the appointment of Adelabu as Minister of Power. In spite of this, the money was not released to the service provider that had already gone ahead to seek funds for the acquisition of smart metres.
“Concerned about the over eight million metre gap in the country and the liquidity squeeze in the Nigeria Electricity Supply Industry, the minister wondered how money meant for a national project could be held up untouched for over 20 years by an individual.
“He, therefore, mounted pressure and escalated the matter to the presidency for the retrieval of the revolving fund from Messrs Ziklagsis plus accrued interest to date. This was duly approved by the President. Upon the President’s approval, N12.7 billion was therefore to be released in tranches to De Haryor Global Services to commence installation of already procured smart meters.
“The minister should therefore be commended for his effort in ensuring the recovery of the revolving metre fund which had been untouchable for over 20 years, thus enabling the eventual take-off of the project.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/06184551/Adebayo-Adelabu-e1709747150216.jpg
business,Excess cash in circulation may worsen inflation – MPC members,Members of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of Nigeria have blamed the excess cash in circulation for the accelerating inflation in the country. This was revealed in the statements th...,21st March 2024,https://punchng.com/excess-cash-in-circulation-may-worsen-inflation-mpc-members/,Oluwakemi Abimbola,"Members of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of Nigeria have blamed the excess cash in circulation for the accelerating inflation in the country.
This was revealed in the statements they made at the February MPC meeting, which was posted on the website of the apex bank on Monday.
One of the MPC members, Pauline Odinkemelu, said, “On the monetary sector, growth in money supply (M3) rose by 18.25 per cent to N93.72tn at end-January 2024 over the preceding December. Broad money (M2) and narrow money (M1) grew by 17.81 and 3.68 per cent, respectively at end-January 2024.
“The growth in broad money supply was driven by the rise in other deposits, transferable deposits, and securities other than shares. In my view, the growth in M1 could further worsen inflationary pressures in the economy, as it signals rising transactional motives or excess liquidity in the system. The motive for holding excess liquidity is generally classified into precautionary or voluntary motives.” 






According to to Odinkemelu, precautionary excess liquidity portion is useful as a buffer for insuring bank capital and uncertainty surrounding customers’ withdrawal, and does not have negative effect on monetary policy.
“However, involuntary motive usually above the desired level– a common feature of developing economies banking system – is not desirable during this period of persistent inflationary pressure, and also influences my decision to vote for monetary policy tightening. In voting for tightening, I am mindful of the implications of a rate hike on the stability of the banking system and therefore, will vote to raise the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) by 300 basis points from 18.75 per cent to 21.75 per cent,” she stated.
Money Supply statistics from the CBN as of January 2024 revealed that currency in circulation surged by 163 per cent in January 2024 to N3.651tn from N1.39tn in the corresponding period of last year.      
Month-on-month, there was a marginal 0.1 per cent decline from the historic high of N3.653tn in December 2023.  Related News  Global warming to raise food prices, inflation- Study  OPS rejects CBN ban lift on dairy products  Inflation is changing consumer behaviour   
In the same vein, currency outside banks grew by 314 per cent to N3.28tn in January 2024 from N0.79tn (January 2023), implying that 89.86 per cent of the currency in circulation was outside the banking system as of January 2024.
That was a notable rise from the 57.14 per cent recorded in January 2023, following the CBN’s naira redesign.
The currency out banking system marked its all-time high at 94 per cent in December 2023 and makes up 84.46 per cent on average of currency in circulation between 1960 and January 2024.
Another MPC member, Mustapha Akinkunmi, added that Nigeria witnessed a decrease in its reserve money to approximately N24.2tn by the end of January 2024, while broad money supply increased to N93.7tn, noting that this exacerbated inflationary pressures within the country.
The Director General of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Lamido Yuguda, who is also a member of the MPC, said that loose monetary policy prevailed for most of 2023 leading to excess liquidity in the system.
“Reserve money increased by 54.28 per cent between December 2022 and December 2023, while broad money (M3) increased by 50.88 per cent over the same period, well above the provisional benchmark of 28.21 per cent.        
“The 50.88 per cent increase in broad money from NGN 52.2tn in December 2022 to N78.7tn in December 2023 was driven mostly by a 46.27 per cent increase in net domestic assets, which rose by NGN 22.4tn. In other words, this represents additional credit created in the economy.” According to Yuguda, while reserve money declined by 2.34 per cent in January 2024 relative to December 2023 driven largely by a decline in liabilities to other depository corporations broad money (M3) increased by 18.25 per cent within one month, adding to the high level of excess liquidity in the system.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/15152345/Inflation.jpg
